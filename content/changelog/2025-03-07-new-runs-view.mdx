We're introducing a new run traces view!

The run traces view has been redesigned to better organize and visualize traces for complex workflows, especially Agentic AI workflows
that may involve many steps with larger payloads and outputs.

Trace visualizations are now more interactive. You can drill into and expand individual run steps to see and work with inputs, outputs and errors.

If at any time you want to jump back to the legacy runs view there is a toggle to do that at the top of the view.
