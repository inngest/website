We are excited to announce the release of [Realtime](/docs/features/realtime), a new feature that allows you to stream updates from your Inngest functions to your users.

Realtime is built upon [Inngest's protocol](/blog/durable-functions-a-visual-javascript-primer), ensuring secure, low-latency and at-most-once delivery of messages.

Read more about the new Realtime APIs available in our TypeScript and Go SDKs in the [release blog post](/blog/announcing-realtime).
