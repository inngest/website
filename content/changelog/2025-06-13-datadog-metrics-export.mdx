You can now export your Inngest metrics to [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/). This enables you and your team to use Inngest's metrics in your existing monitoring and alerting systems.

To get started, visit the new [Datadog](https://app.inngest.com/settings/integrations/datadog) page in the "Integrations" section of the Inngest dashboard and follow the instructions to get the scrape config for the environment that you want to export metrics from.
