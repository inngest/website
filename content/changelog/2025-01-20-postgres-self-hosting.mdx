Postgres support is now available for self-hosted Inngest. This enables you to use Postgres as your event storage backend, instead of the default SQLite. This will be marked as experimental until additional testing is completed and feedback is received.

Available in the Inngest CLI [`v1.4.0`](https://github.com/inngest/inngest/releases/tag/v1.4.0) with the `--postgres-uri` flag.
