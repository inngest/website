[Singleton Functions](/docs/guides/singleton) is a new Flow Control feature that allows you to exclusive execution of an Inngest function.

Unlike [Rate Limiting](/docs/guides/rate-limiting) which discard events given a configured time window, Singleton Functions discard events (or cancel runs) only if an execution is already running.
