The new webhooks management API endpoints are now available as part of the [Inngest REST API](https://api-docs.inngest.com/).

You can now create, update, and delete webhooks for your Inngest account, including updating transform functions. This enables you to:

* Manage webhook transforms within your codebase, including adding unit tests for your transforms.
* Programmatically create, update, and delete webhooks for customers or integrations.

To help you get started, we created [a webhook transform sync demo repo](https://github.com/inngest/webhook-transform-sync) that shows how you can test and sync transforms between your codebase and Inngest.
