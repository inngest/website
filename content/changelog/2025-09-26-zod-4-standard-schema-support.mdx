export const title = "Zod 4 and Standard Schema support in the TypeScript SDK";
export const date = "2025-09-26";

Our TypeScript SDK now supports the Standard Schema interface, which allows you to now use Zod 4 to define your event payload types. The [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev/?ref=inngest) interface is a standard way to define event payload types in a way that is easy to use and understand. This means that schemas can now be defined with:

* [Zod](https://zod.dev/?ref=inngest)
* [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/?ref=inngest)
* [ArkType](https://arktype.io/?ref=inngest)
* [joi](https://joi.dev/?ref=inngest)
* and [more](https://standardschema.dev/?ref=inngest)!

Upgrade to SDK [v3.42.0](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/releases/tag/inngest%403.42.0) or higher and check out [the documentation](/docs/reference/client/create?ref=changelog-zod-4-standard-schema-support#defining-event-payload-types) for more information.
