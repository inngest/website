The CMD+K quick search in Cloud is now even more powerful!

In addition to searching by event and run ID, you can now find results by app, event, and function names, making it easier than ever to locate what you need in each environment.

We've also added quick access to useful pages (like signing keys) and top actions (such as adding an app), making navigation even faster.

Coming soon: the ability to view recent searches. What other actions would you like to access instantly? Let us know!
