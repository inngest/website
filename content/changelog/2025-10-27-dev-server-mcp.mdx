We are excited to announce the release of [MCP Integration](/docs/ai-dev-tools/mcp), bringing AI-assisted development workflows to the Inngest dev server. Connect Claude Code, Cursor, and other AI assistants directly to your local Inngest functions for seamless testing and debugging.

The MCP server provides comprehensive access to your development environment with 8 powerful tools:

- **Event management** - Send events and discover registered functions
- **Real-time monitoring** - Track function execution and debug failures with detailed traces
- **Direct function invocation** - Execute functions synchronously and get immediate results
- **Documentation access** - Search and read Inngest documentation offline
- **Integration testing** - Poll multiple runs to verify complex workflows

Learn more in the [MCP Integration documentation](/docs/ai-dev-tools/mcp).
