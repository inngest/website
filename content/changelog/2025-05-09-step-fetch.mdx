export const title = "Introducing the Fetch APIs";

We are thrilled to release [Fetch](/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows/fetch), a set of new APIs to make durable HTTP requests within an Inngest function.
Now available in our TypeScript SDK, the `step.fetch()` API and the `fetch()` utility enable you to make requests to third-party APIs or fetch data in a durable way by offloading them to the Inngest Platform.

```typescript
const processFiles = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "process-files" },
  { event: "files/process" },
  async ({ step }) => {
    // The request is offloaded to the Inngest Platform
    const response = await step.fetch("https://api.example.com/files", {
      method: "GET",
      headers: {
        "Authorization": `Bearer ${process.env.API_KEY}`
      }
    })

    // Your Inngest function is resumed here with the response
    await step.run("process-file", async (file) => {
      const body = await response.json()
      // body.files
    })
  }
)
```
