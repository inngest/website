We are excited to announce the release of [Connect](/docs/setup/connect), a new feature that allows you to connect your application to Inngest over one or multiple outbound persistent connections, bringing:

- **Lower latency** - No need for multiple HTTP requests to Inngest to process a single function.
- **Elastic horizontal scaling** - Easily add more capacity by running additional workers.
- **Ideal for container runtimes** -  Deploy on Kubernetes or ECS without the need of a load balancer for inbound traffic
- **Simpler long running steps** - Step execution is not bound by platform http timeouts.
