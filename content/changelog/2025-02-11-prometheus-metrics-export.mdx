You can now export your Inngest metrics to [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/). This enables you and your team to use Inngest's metrics in your existing monitoring and alerting systems.

Several metrics are now available to export, including:

* `inngest_function_run_scheduled_total`
* `inngest_function_run_started_total`
* `inngest_function_run_ended_total`
* Read the full list of metrics in the [docs](/docs/metrics/prometheus).

To get started, visit the new [Prometheus](https://app.inngest.com/settings/integrations/prometheus) page in the "Integrations" section of the Inngest dashboard and follow the instructions to get the scrape config for the environment that you want to export metrics from.

It's available on all paid plans today. Read more information in the [docs](/docs/metrics/prometheus).
