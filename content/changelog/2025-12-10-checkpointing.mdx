We're thrilled to release the developer preview of a new Inngest's orchestration engine capability: **Checkpointing**.
By enabling checkpointing, Inngest workflows stay durable while achieving near-zero inter-step latency.

Checkpointing is designed to support the growing need for real-time Inngest workflows—such as AI workflows—powering interactive and reliable user experiences.

We've been dogfooding Checkpointing for several weeks, and the results are astonishing: **near-zero inter-step latency** and an overall **50% reduction in workflow duration**.

**Checkpointing is currently available in developer preview** as an opt-in configuration at the client or function level.
