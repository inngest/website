Background jobs are core to web applications, keeping the user experience responsive by moving some backend work outside of the API.

With background jobs, any backend work not directly tied to the user experience or slow operations such as importing contacts is moved into asynchronous backend operations.
These background jobs can send updates upon completion, for example, via emails, or send real-time updates with streamed messages to keep users informed of the process (for example, sending a batch of emails).

In this article, you'll learn how to add background jobs with real-time updates in Next.js using [Inngest](/docs?ref=blogpost-nextjs-bg-jobs-realtime).

## Project overview: CampaignCraft

CampaignCraft is a Next.js application that helps in sending personalized email campaigns by automatically segmenting uploaded contacts CSV files and drafting AI campaigns.

_TODO: video_

CampaignCraft is built with the following technologies:
- **Next.js** - The full-stack application framework
- **Shadcn** - The UIKit library providing all UI components
- **Vercel** - The de facto deployment platform for Next.js applications
- **OpenAI** - To power all AI features
- **Neon** - Our Postgres database to store contacts and campaigns
- **Drizzle** - The ORM used to interact with the Neon database
- **Inngest** - The background jobs engine powering our contacts import and campaign sending features

The two primary features of CampaignCraft—automatically segmenting uploaded contact files and sending campaigns—leverage background jobs with real-time updates for a smoother user experience.

The final project is [available on GitHub](#TODO) along with README setup instructions.

## Implementation overview

Our project relies on two main concepts to deliver a smooth user experience: background jobs and real-time updates.

### How do background jobs work?

Background jobs allow your application to handle time-consuming or resource-intensive tasks outside of the main user request/response cycle. Instead of making users wait for operations like importing large CSV files, sending bulk emails, or generating AI-powered content, you can offload these tasks to run asynchronously in the background.

_TODO: illustration_

When invoked, a background job gets added to a queue processed by a background jobs engine (e.g., [Inngest](/docs?ref=blogpost-nextjs-bg-jobs-realtime)) that picks jobs from the queue in the correct order.
In addition to moving time-consuming work outside of the API, background jobs also enable retrying failed jobs, bringing more reliability to backend work coupled with external services like LLM APIs or email providers:

_TODO: illustration_


Here's how it works in a Next.js app:

1. **User triggers an action**: For example, uploading a CSV of contacts by clicking "Import contacts"
2. **API enqueues a background job**: Instead of processing everything immediately, your API endpoint creates a job (using Inngest) describing the work to be done.
3. **Job runs asynchronously**: Inngest picks up the job and runs it in the background, independent of the user's request.
4. **User gets an immediate response**: The API can quickly respond to the user (e.g., "Import started!"), keeping the UI fast and responsive.
5. **Job progress and completion**: As the job runs, it can update the database and send an email notification once the import is complete.

**Why use background jobs?**
- **Performance**: Keeps your API endpoints fast by moving heavy work out of the request cycle.
- **Reliability**: Jobs can be retried automatically if they fail, ensuring important work gets done.
- **Scalability**: Jobs can be processed in parallel, handling large workloads efficiently.
- **User Experience**: Users aren't left waiting for slow operations—they can continue using your app while work happens in the background.



### How do real-time updates work?

Real-time updates allow your application to instantly inform users about the progress of long-running background jobs—without requiring them to refresh the page or poll for updates. This is especially important for workflows like sending bulk emails, where users want to see live feedback on the status of their actions.

Real-time updates are made possible by a technology called **[WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)**.
WebSocket is a protocol that enables persistent, two-way communication between the browser and the server.
Unlike traditional HTTP requests, which require the client to repeatedly ask the server for new information (polling), a WebSocket connection stays open, allowing the server to instantly push updates to the client as soon as something changes.
This makes it ideal for delivering live progress, notifications, and logs from your background jobs directly to the user's browser in real time (without the latency of polling every _x_ seconds).


Here's how it works:

1. **Background job emits messages**: As your job processes data (e.g., importing contacts or sending emails), it sends progress updates or status messages using Inngest's Realtime API.
2. **Frontend subscribes to updates**: Your React components use a hook or subscription to listen for these messages, scoped to the current user or job.
3. **UI updates instantly**: As soon as a new message is received, the UI updates in real time—showing progress bars, logs, or notifications.

_TODO: illustration_

**Benefits of real-time updates:**
- **Transparency**: Users can see exactly what's happening, reducing uncertainty.
- **Engagement**: Live feedback keeps users engaged and informed, especially during long operations.
- **Error handling**: If something goes wrong, users are notified immediately and can take action.



## Inngest as a background jobs engine

While this guide focuses on two primary use cases requiring background jobs, improving the user experience or scaling your web applications is a wider topic involving other concepts such as scalability with Flow Control, recovery tactics for production use cases, and more.

[Inngest](/docs?ref=blogpost-nextjs-bg-jobs-realtime) is an orchestration engine enabling developers to build, operate, and scale background jobs and workflows.
Its TypeScript SDK provides features ranging from simple background jobs to more [advanced scalable workflows designed for scale](/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows?ref=blogpost-nextjs-bg-jobs-realtime).
In addition to its SDKs, Inngest also provides a platform offering [observability](/docs/platform/monitor/observability-metrics?ref=blogpost-nextjs-bg-jobs-realtime) (charts & usage), [recovery tools](/docs/platform/replay?ref=blogpost-nextjs-bg-jobs-realtime) (bulk cancellations, job replays), and integrations with other platforms like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/marketplace/inngest). Finally, Inngest's Realtime feature provides an API to send real-time updates to users for long-running background jobs.

You can install and configure Inngest in your Next.js app in under 5 minutes [by following this quickstart](/docs/getting-started/nextjs-quick-start?ref=blogpost-nextjs-bg-jobs-realtime).


## Installing new dependencies

You can install the Inngest SDK and its Realtime SDK using the following command:

```bash
npm i inngest @inngest/realtime
```

## Setting up Inngest

Let's start by installing and configuring Inngest in CampaignCraft.

First, we'll create a new `inngest/functions.ts` file as follows:

```ts src/inngest/functions
import { Inngest } from 'inngest'

export const client = new Inngest({
   id: 'campaign-craft'
})

// our background jobs definition will go here
```

Then, we will create a new Next.js API Route to enable the Inngest orchestration engine to trigger background jobs defined in the application:

```ts app/api/inngest/routes.ts
import { serve } from "inngest/next";
import { inngest } from "@/src/inngest/functions";

export const { GET, POST, PUT } = serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions: [
    // we will reference our background jobs here
  ],
});

```

Inngest is now set up in the Next.js app. Let's now look at how to implement the contacts importer feature using a background job.

## Import contacts from a background job

CampaignCraft's first main feature is a CSV contacts import which segments the newly imported contacts using AI (OpenAI).

Implementing this feature directly in a Next.js API Route comes with many drawbacks:
- The import and AI processes are tied to the user request
- The import and AI processes are slow, forcing the user to stay on the page until the import finishes (even with a Next.js streaming response).
- A single LLM request failure will cancel the whole import, without retrying.

For this reason, we will implement this feature using a background job,
- Enabling the user to leave the page after submitting the file and getting notified by email when the import is complete
- Enforcing automatic isolated [retries](/docs/features/inngest-functions/error-retries/retries?ref=blogpost-nextjs-bg-jobs-realtime), making the import and AI processing more resilient

First, let's update the existing `POST /api/contacts` API Route to trigger the background job:

```ts app/api/contacts/route.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { inngest } from "@/lib/inngest";

// POST /api/contacts - import contacts (triggers Inngest job)
export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  // For simplicity, assume JSON body with contacts array (CSV parsing can be added later)
  const data = await req.json();
  // Send event to Inngest
  await inngest.send({
    name: "app/contact.import",
    data,
  });
  return NextResponse.json(
    { success: true, message: "Import job triggered via Inngest" },
    { status: 202 }
  );
}
```

  **Inngest background jobs are triggered using events**

  You can see events as arguments of background jobs. `inngest.send()` is used to [send an event](/docs/guides/sending-events-from-functions?ref=blogpost-nextjs-bg-jobs-realtime) to Inngest which will enqueue an execution of our `contact-import` background job.
</aside>

Let's now implement the `contact-import` background job.


### Writing our first background job: `contact-import`

Background jobs written with Inngest are defined using the `inngest.createFunction()` method, as shown in the `src/inngest/functions.ts` file below:

```ts src/inngest/functions.ts
import { Inngest } from 'inngest'
import { eq } from "drizzle-orm";

import { db,  contacts, contactSegments, segments } from "@/lib/db";
import { segmentContacts } from "@/lib/openai";
import { sendEmail } from "@/lib/resend";

export const client = new Inngest({
   id: 'campaign-craft'
})


export const contactImport = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "contact-import" },
  { event: "app/contact.import" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    // 1. Parse contacts from event data
    const contactList = event.data.contacts;
    if (!Array.isArray(contactList) || contactList.length === 0) {
      return { success: false, message: "No contacts provided" };
    }
    // Require email for each contact
    if (contactList.some((c) => !c.email)) {
      return { success: false, message: "All contacts must have an email" };
    }
    // 2. Insert contacts into the database
    const inserted = await step.run("insert-contacts", async () => {
      return db.insert(contacts).values(contactList).returning();
    });

    // 3. Segment contacts using OpenAI (as an Inngest step)
    const segmentation = await segmentContacts(inserted, step);

    await step.run("save-segments-and-assignments", async () => {
      // 1. Insert segments (if not already present)
      //    For simplicity, insert all segments and ignore conflicts (e.g., on name)
      await db
        .insert(segments)
        .values(
          segmentation.segments.map((s) => ({
            name: s.name,
            description: s.description ?? null,
          }))
        )
        .onConflictDoNothing()
        .returning();

      // 2. Fetch all segments to get their IDs (by name)
      const allSegments = await db.select().from(segments);
      const segmentNameToId = Object.fromEntries(
        allSegments.map((s) => [s.name, s.id])
      );

      // 3. Insert assignments into contact_segments
      await db
        .insert(contactSegments)
        .values(
          segmentation.assignments.map((a) => ({
            contactId: a.contactId,
            segmentId: segmentNameToId[a.segmentName],
          }))
        )
        .onConflictDoNothing();
    });

    // 4. Send notification
    await step.run('send-notification', async () => {
      return await sendEmail({
          to: process.env.ADMIN_EMAIL!,
          subject: `Contacts import completed!`,
          html: `${contactList} has been imported into the following segments: ${segmentation.segments.map(s => s.name)}`,
        });
    })
    
    return {
      success: true,
      imported: inserted.length,
      contactIds: inserted.map((c) => c.id),
      segmentation,
    };
  }
);
```

<aside className="max-w-[65ch] m-auto bg-indigo-900/20 text-indigo-100 leading-relaxed rounded-lg py-0 px-6  my-12 border border-indigo-900/50">
  **Inngest background jobs are composed of steps**

  The [`step.run()`](/docs/learn/inngest-steps?ref=blogpost-nextjs-bg-jobs-realtime) block present in the `contact-import` background job helps in dividing our background job into individual retriable units. When a step fails, this enables Inngest to recover your background job from where it failed, without re-running all the steps.
  This prevents any unwanted duplicate database inserts or costly LLM requests.
</aside>

Let's now create a background job sending real-time updates for the campaign sending feature.


## Sending campaigns using a real-time background job

Sending a campaign is a quicker process than importing contacts. Still, it benefits from running inside a background job to enable the user to leave the page before it completes or to make it more resilient to failures.

To keep the user informed of the progress of the batch email sending, our `campaign-send` background job will send regular real-time updates.


### Configuring Inngest Realtime

[Inngest Realtime](/docs/features/realtime?ref=blogpost-nextjs-bg-jobs-realtime) provides a simple API to stream updates from background jobs to React components.

First, let's update our Inngest client configuration by adding the `@inngest/realtime` middleware:

```ts src/inngest/functions.ts
import { Inngest } from "inngest";
import { realtimeMiddleware } from "@inngest/realtime";

// ...

export const inngest = new Inngest({
  id: "campaigncraft-app",
  middleware: [realtimeMiddleware()],
});

// ...
```

Then, below the `contact-import` Inngest function, let's define a unique channel that we will later use to send real-time messages:

```ts src/inngest/functions.ts
import { channel, topic } from "@inngest/realtime";
import { z } from "zod";
import { eq } from "drizzle-orm";

import { inngest } from "@/lib/inngest";
import { db, campaigns, contacts, contactSegments, segments } from "@/lib/db";
import { segmentContacts } from "@/lib/openai";
import { sendEmail } from "@/lib/resend";

// Inngest client definition ...

// `contact-import` function definition ...

// create a channel for each campaign, given a campaign ID. A channel is a namespace for one or more topics of streams.
export const campaignSendChannel = channel(
  (campaignId: string) => `campaign-send:${campaignId}`
).addTopic(
  topic("progress").schema(
    z.object({
      message: z.string(),
      complete: z.boolean(),
    })
  )
);
```

<aside className="max-w-[65ch] m-auto bg-indigo-900/20 text-indigo-100 leading-relaxed rounded-lg py-0 px-6  my-12 border border-indigo-900/50">
  **Inngest Realtime: channels and topics**

  [Inngest Realtime](/docs/features/realtime?ref=blogpost-nextjs-bg-jobs-realtime) enables you to send real-time updates from background jobs to React components using 2 concepts: channels and topics.

  - Channels contain different types of messages belonging to the same background job, for example: a batch sending of emails for a given campaign.
  - Topics are different types of messages belonging to a given channel.
</aside>

### Sending Real-time messages

Our second background job, `campaign-send`, features some new calls to a new API: `publish()`.
This API enables you to send messages to a given channel and topic:

```ts src/inngest/functions.ts
import { channel, topic } from "@inngest/realtime";
import { z } from "zod";
import { eq } from "drizzle-orm";

import { inngest } from "@/lib/inngest";
import { db, campaigns, contacts, contactSegments, segments } from "@/lib/db";

// create a channel for each campaign, given a campaign ID. A channel is a namespace for one or more topics of streams.
export const campaignSendChannel = channel(
  (campaignId: string) => `campaign-send:${campaignId}`
).addTopic(
  topic("progress").schema(
    z.object({
      message: z.string(),
      complete: z.boolean(),
    })
  )
);

export const campaignSend = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "campaign-send" },
  { event: "app/campaign.send" },
  async ({ event, step, publish }) => {
    const {
      campaignId,
      segmentId,
      scheduledAt,
      subject: eventSubject,
      content: eventContent,
    } = event.data;

    await publish(
      campaignSendChannel(campaignId).progress({
        message: "Preparing the campaign...",
        complete: false,
      })
    );

    // 1. Fetch campaign
    const [campaign] = await db
      .select()
      .from(campaigns)
      .where(eq(campaigns.id, campaignId));
    if (!campaign) {
      return { success: false, message: "Campaign not found", campaignId };
    }

    // 2. Fetch contacts in the segment (with email)
    const segmentContacts = await db
      .select({
        id: contacts.id,
        firstname: contacts.firstname,
        lastname: contacts.lastname,
        email: contacts.email,
      })
      .from(contacts)
      .innerJoin(contactSegments, eq(contactSegments.contactId, contacts.id))
      .where(eq(contactSegments.segmentId, segmentId));

    await publish(
      campaignSendChannel(campaignId).progress({
        message: `Sending ${campaign.name} to ${segmentContacts.length} contacts`,
        complete: false,
      })
    );

    const emailSubject = eventSubject || campaign.subject;
    const emailContent = eventContent || campaign.content;

    // 3. Send emails using Resend
    const results = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < segmentContacts.length; i++) {
      const contact = segmentContacts[i];
      await step.run('send-email', async () => {
        const res = await sendEmail({
          to: contact.email,
          subject: emailSubject,
          html: emailContent,
        });
        results.push({
          contactId: contact.id,
          email: contact.email,
          status: "sent",
          messageId: res.data?.id,
        });
      })
      // Every 5 contacts, publish progress
      if ((i + 1) % 5 === 0 || i === segmentContacts.length - 1) {
        await publish(
          campaignSendChannel(campaignId).progress({
            message: `Sent ${i + 1} of ${segmentContacts.length} contacts... (Subject: ${emailSubject})`,
            complete: false,
          })
        );
      }
    }

    await campaignSendChannel(campaignId).progress({
      message: `The ${campaign.name} is now sent! (Subject: ${emailSubject})`,
      complete: true,
    });

    // 5. Return summary
    return {
      success: true,
      campaignId,
      segmentId,
      scheduledAt,
      sent: results.filter((r) => r.status === "sent").length,
      failed: results.filter((r) => r.status === "error").length,
      results,
      message: "Campaign send job completed",
    };
  }
);
```

Let's now update our front-end (React components) to subscribe to the real-time updates!

### Subscribing to real-time messages from the front-end

Subscribing to real-time updates sent from Inngest background jobs requires two changes.

First, create an `app/actions.ts` file as follows:

```ts app/actions.ts
"use server";

import { inngest } from "@/lib/inngest";
import { campaignSendChannel } from "@/src/inngest/functions";
import { getSubscriptionToken, Realtime } from "@inngest/realtime";

// securely fetch an Inngest Realtime subscription token from the server as a server action
export async function fetchSubscriptionToken(
  campaignId: string
): Promise<Realtime.Token<typeof campaignSendChannel, ["progress"]>> {
  const token = await getSubscriptionToken(inngest, {
    channel: campaignSendChannel(campaignId),
    topics: ["progress"],
  });

  return token;
}
```

<aside className="max-w-[65ch] m-auto bg-indigo-900/20 text-indigo-100 leading-relaxed rounded-lg py-0 px-6  my-12 border border-indigo-900/50">
  **Inngest Realtime: subscription token**

  Inngest Realtime requires you to create a Server Action to securely fetch a subscription token from the server.

  This subscription token is later used by the [`useInngestSubscription()`](/docs/features/realtime/react-hooks?ref=blogpost-nextjs-bg-jobs-realtime) React hook to subscribe to live updates.
</aside>

Let's now add the [`useInngestSubscription()`](/docs/features/realtime/react-hooks?ref=blogpost-nextjs-bg-jobs-realtime) hook to our Next.js page to subscribe to live updates:

```tsx app/campaign/[id]/page.tsx
"use client";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useParams } from "next/navigation";

import { useInngestSubscription } from "@inngest/realtime/hooks";

import { fetchSubscriptionToken } from "@/app/actions";


export default function CampaignViewPage() {
   const { id } = useParams();
  const [enabled, setUpdatesEnabled] = useState<boolean>(true);

  const { latestData: latestUpdate } = useInngestSubscription({
    refreshToken: () => fetchSubscriptionToken(id as string),
    bufferInterval: 500,
    enabled,
  });

   // ...

  async function handleSend() {
   const res = await fetch(`/api/campaigns/${id}/send`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ subject, content }),
   });
   if (!res.ok) throw new Error(await res.text());
   setUpdatesEnabled(true);
  }

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-8 py-12">
      <div className="flex items-center gap-4 mb-4">
        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Edit Campaign: {campaign.name}</h1>
      </div>
      <form className="flex flex-col gap-6 max-w-xl">
        {/* ... */}
      </form>
      {/* Updates Section */}
      {latestUpdate ? (
        <>
          <div className="mt-8">
            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">
              Your campaign is being sent!
            </h2>
            {latestUpdate.data.message}
          </div>
        </>
      ) : null}
    </div>
  );
}
```

CampaignCraft is now leveraging two background jobs to power a smooth user experience. Let's test it out!

## Try it!

Start the Next.js application by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```


Then, start the [Inngest DevServer](/docs/local-development?ref=blogpost-nextjs-bg-jobs-realtime) as follows:

```bash
npx inngest-cli@latest dev
```

Open the Inngest DevServer ([127.0.0.1:8288/runs](http://127.0.0.1:8288/runs)) in a new tab.

Then, open CampaignCraft at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and click on "Import contacts."
From the import page, select the `fake_contacts.csv` file available in the repository and import it.

You should see the import process running in the Inngest DevServer.

Now navigate back to the home page, and click on the "Create Campaign" button. Create a campaign by selecting a segment, generating some AI content, and sending it. You will see the campaign being sent with real-time updates.

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored how to implement real-time updates for background jobs in a Next.js application using Inngest Realtime. The main concepts covered include:

- **[Background Jobs](/docs/guides/background-jobs?ref=blogpost-nextjs-bg-jobs-realtime)**: Offloading long-running or resource-intensive tasks (like sending email campaigns) to run asynchronously in the background, improving user experience and scalability.
- **[Inngest Realtime](/docs/features/realtime?ref=blogpost-nextjs-bg-jobs-realtime)**: Leveraging Inngest's real-time capabilities to send live updates from background jobs to the frontend, enabling users to see progress and results as they happen.
- **[Channels and Topics](/docs/features/realtime?ref=blogpost-nextjs-bg-jobs-realtime)**: Organizing real-time messages using channels (grouping messages for a specific background job) and topics (categorizing message types within a channel).
- **[Subscription Tokens](/docs/features/realtime/react-hooks?ref=blogpost-nextjs-bg-jobs-realtime)**: Securely generating tokens on the server to allow clients to subscribe to specific channels and topics, ensuring only authorized access to updates.
- **[React Integration](/docs/features/realtime/react-hooks?ref=blogpost-nextjs-bg-jobs-realtime)**: Using the `useInngestSubscription` hook in React components to subscribe to updates, and updating the UI in response to new messages from background jobs.

By combining these concepts, you can build responsive, user-friendly applications that keep users informed about the status of their background processes in real time.


## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I limit the number of concurrent background jobs running at once?**

You can limit the number of concurrent runs for a given background job by configuring `concurrency`.
The background job below will only have 2 concurrent runs at the same time (at most):

```ts
export const contactImport = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "contact-import", concurrency: 2 },
  { event: "app/contact.import" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
   // ...
  }
)
```

**Q: Can I limit the background jobs retries?**

Background jobs are retried up to 4 times by default and can be configured using the `retries` option.
The example below shows a function with no retries:


```ts
export const contactImport = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "contact-import", retries: 0 },
  { event: "app/contact.import" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
   // ...
  }
)
```

**Q: What happens if the client loses connection during a background job?**

The `useInngestSubscription()` React hook provided by `@inngest/realtime` will automatically resume any lost connection.
Any permanent loss of connection will be reflected in the `error` and `state` properties returned by the hook:

```tsx
// ...

const { data, error, state } = useInngestSubscription({
   refreshToken: () => fetchSubscriptionToken(id as string),
   bufferInterval: 500,
   enabled,
});

// state === "closed"

// ...
```

**Q: Is it possible to subscribe to multiple channels or topics at once?**

Every subscription is bound to a channel and one or more of its topics.

To subscribe to multiple topics from a given channel, list them in the `topics` argument passed to `getSubscriptionToken()`:

```ts app/actions.ts
"use server";

import { inngest } from "@/lib/inngest";
import { myChannel } from "@/src/inngest/functions";
import { getSubscriptionToken, Realtime } from "@inngest/realtime";

// securely fetch an Inngest Realtime subscription token from the server as a server action
export async function fetchSubscriptionToken(
  campaignId: string
): Promise<Realtime.Token<typeof myChannel, ["progress"]>> {
  const token = await getSubscriptionToken(inngest, {
    channel: myChannel(campaignId),
    topics: ["topic1", "topic2", "topic3"],
  });

  return token;

```

To subscribe to multiple channels, create multiple subscription tokens and call `useInngestSubscription()` once per channel.

**Q: How do I handle errors or retries in the background job and reflect them in the UI?**

Inngest offers multiple ways to handle errors, as described [in this guide](/docs/guides/error-handling).
