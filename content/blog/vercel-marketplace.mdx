Our [first Vercel Integration](/blog/vercel-integration), released in late 2022, made it easier for now more than 10,000 Next.js developers to get started with Inngest.
Today, we are thrilled to extend our partnership with Vercel by natively integrating with the Vercel Platform, bringing **the configuration
of Inngest applications** as well as **usage charts** and **unified billing** directly from your Vercel dashboard.

This new native integration provides a smoother experience, enabling you to connect a Vercel project to Inngest in a few clicks.


## Get Started

To connect a new or existing Vercel project to Inngest, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Vercel Marketplace's Inngest page](https://vercel.com/inngest/~/integrations/inngest)
2. Scroll down to the "Products" section and click on "Install"
3. From there, you'll be able to connect your Vercel account to an existing Inngest account or create a new one (_and select a plan_)
4. Once installed, you'll be able to connect your Vercel projects to an Inngest application in a single click
