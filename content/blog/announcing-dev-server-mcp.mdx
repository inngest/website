We're excited to announce the release of **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for the Inngest dev server, bringing AI-assisted development workflows directly to your local function testing and debugging experience.

With this integration, AI assistants like Claude Code and Cursor can now connect directly to your running Inngest dev server, enabling them to send test events, monitor function execution in real-time, debug failures with detailed traces, and access Inngest documentation—all without leaving your development environment.

## What is Model Context Protocol?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an emerging standard that allows AI assistants to connect to external tools and data sources. Instead of just generating code, AI can now actively interact with your development environment, test your functions, monitor their execution, and help debug issues as they occur.

For Inngest developers, this means your AI assistant can:
- Send test events to trigger your functions
- Monitor function execution and get detailed step information
- Debug failures with comprehensive trace data
- Access the full Inngest documentation offline
- Poll multiple runs for integration testing workflows

## The Challenge of Testing Serverless Functions

Testing and debugging serverless functions has always been challenging. Traditional debugging approaches break down when your functions are:
- Triggered by external events
- Running asynchronously with multiple steps
- Dependent on complex state management
- Part of larger workflow orchestrations

Until now, debugging a failing Inngest function meant:
1. Manually triggering events through the UI
2. Switching between your code editor and browser
3. Hunting through logs to understand what went wrong
4. Recreating complex event scenarios by hand

**With MCP integration, your AI assistant can handle all of this automatically.**

## AI-Powered Development Workflows

### Automated Function Testing

Your AI assistant can now test your functions directly:

```typescript
// AI can automatically test this function
export const handleUserSignup = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "handle-user-signup" },
  { event: "app/user.created" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    const user = await step.run("create-user", async () => {
      return createUser(event.data);
    });
    
    await step.run("send-welcome-email", async () => {
      return sendEmail(user.email, "welcome");
    });
    
    return { userId: user.id, emailSent: true };
  }
);
```

The AI can:
1. Send a test `app/user.created` event with realistic data
2. Monitor the function execution in real-time
3. Verify each step completed successfully
4. Check the final output matches expectations
5. Debug any failures with detailed error traces

### Real-Time Debugging Assistance

When functions fail, AI can immediately investigate:

```bash
# AI automatically sends this event
> send_event: "app/user.created" with data: { email: "test@example.com", name: "John Doe" }

# AI monitors the execution
> poll_run_status: waiting for runs [01J5QH90...] to complete

# AI detects failure and investigates
> get_run_status: analyzing failed run 01J5QH90...

Function 'handle-user-signup' failed at step 'send-welcome-email'
Error: SMTP connection timeout
Duration: 15,234ms
```

The AI can then:
- Analyze the error context
- Search documentation for SMTP configuration guidance
- Suggest fixes based on the specific failure mode
- Test the fix immediately

### Integration Testing Made Simple

For complex workflows involving multiple functions, AI can orchestrate comprehensive testing:

```typescript
// AI can test this entire workflow
const signupWorkflow = [
  "app/user.created",      // Triggers user creation
  "app/user.verified",     // Triggers account setup  
  "app/welcome.sent"       // Triggers onboarding flow
];
```

The AI sends all events, monitors all resulting function runs, and verifies the entire workflow completes successfully—automatically catching issues in multi-function integrations that are easy to miss manually.

## Eight MCP Tools

The Inngest MCP server provides eight tools organized into three categories:

### Event Management
- **`send_event`** - Trigger functions with test events and get immediate run IDs
- **`list_functions`** - Discover available functions and their event triggers
- **`invoke_function`** - Execute functions synchronously and get immediate results

### Execution Monitoring  
- **`get_run_status`** - Get detailed status and trace information for specific runs
- **`poll_run_status`** - Monitor multiple runs until completion for integration testing

### Documentation Access
- **`grep_docs`** - Search embedded Inngest documentation with pattern matching
- **`read_doc`** - Read complete documentation files for context
- **`list_docs`** - Browse available documentation categories and SDK coverage

All documentation is embedded directly in the CLI binary, providing instant offline access to the complete Inngest knowledge base.

## Zero Setup

The MCP integration runs entirely locally with your dev server—no API keys, no external services, no additional dependencies. Simply:

1. **Start your dev server** as usual:
   ```bash
   npx inngest-cli dev
   ```

2. **Configure your AI tool** to connect to `http://localhost:8288/mcp`

3. **Start building** with AI assistance immediately

Your AI assistant now has complete access to your local Inngest development environment.

## Getting Started

### With Claude Code

Add this configuration to connect Claude Code to your local dev server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "inngest-dev": {
      "command": "curl",
      "args": [
        "-X", "POST",
        "http://127.0.0.1:8288/mcp",
        "-H", "Content-Type: application/json",
        "-d", "@-"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### With Cursor

Configure Cursor's MCP settings to connect to your local Inngest dev server at `http://localhost:8288/mcp`.

### With Other AI Tools

Any MCP-compatible AI assistant can connect using the standard MCP HTTP transport protocol.

## The Future of Function Development

This integration represents a fundamental shift in how we build and debug serverless functions. Instead of functions being black boxes that we probe from the outside, AI can now work alongside the execution environment, providing real-time insight and assistance.

We're just getting started. Future enhancements will include:
- AI-assisted function optimization based on execution traces
- Automatic test generation from function behavior patterns  
- Intelligent error diagnosis with suggested fixes
- Integration with production monitoring for AI-assisted debugging

## Try It Today

The MCP integration is available now in the latest version of the Inngest CLI. Start your dev server and experience AI-assisted function development firsthand.
