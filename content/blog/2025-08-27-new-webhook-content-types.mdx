Webhooks are now more flexible with the addition of `x-www-form-urlencoded` and `multipart/form-data` content types. When sending a request with either of these content types, your webhook transform will have access to both a JSON object representation of the body and the raw body as a string.

For example, if you send a webhook request like the following:

```sh
curl https://inn.gs/e/REDACTED \
  -H "content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "name=Alice&messages=hello&messages=world"
```

And your webhook transform looks like this:
```js
function transform(json, headers, queryParams, raw) {
  return {
    name: "hi",
    data: { json, raw },
  };
};
```

Then the resulting event data will be:
```json
{
  "json": {
    "messages": ["hello", "world"],
    "name": ["Alice"]
  },
  "raw": "name=Alice&messages=hello&messages=world"
}
```

Note that the JSON object's values are always arrays of strings.
