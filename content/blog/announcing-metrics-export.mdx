**Observability is one of the core focuses of Inngest**. Following the [revamp of our traces view and monitoring last September](/blog/enhanced-observability-traces-and-metrics), we are
thrilled to introduce the Datadog and Prometheus integrations.

As more and more customers are growing with Inngest, we've seen a need to integrate Inngest metrics into existing monitoring and alerting systems.
The [Datadog](/docs/platform/monitor/datadog-integration) and [Prometheus](/docs/platform/monitor/prometheus-metrics-export-integration) integrations **are now available on all paid plans to export a wide range of metrics**, from function runs, SDK requests, to step executions, into your existing monitoring and alerting systems.



## Datadog integration: ready-to-use dashboards and custom alerting

Our Datadog integration can be installed in a few clicks, without any agent configuration.

Once installed, you can use our [ready-to-use dashboards](/docs/platform/monitor/datadog-integration) to monitor your Inngest functions and set up custom alerting:

The Datadog integration exports over 12 metrics, with a granularity down to the minute and in real-time ([depending on your plan](/docs/platform/monitor/datadog-integration#metrics)).


Get started with the [Datadog integration](/docs/platform/monitor/datadog-integration).


## Prometheus integration: metrics for New Relic, Grafana, and more

The [Prometheus integration](/docs/platform/monitor/prometheus-metrics-export-integration) enables exporting up to 9 metrics to [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)-compatible monitoring systems such as [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

This integration is available on all paid plans and offers more flexibility by enabling self-hosted or custom monitoring systems support.

Get started with the [Prometheus integration](/docs/platform/monitor/prometheus-metrics-export-integration).




## Looking forward

The observability of Inngest Functions is constantly evolving. Here is a glimpse of what we are working on:
- **Alerting**: we are working on an alerting feature, allowing you to create alerts in the Inngest dashboard.
- **More metrics**: We are also exploring the possibility of including [our AI traces](/blog/ai-orchestration-with-agentkit-step-ai) in these integrations.

All Inngest features are built with the community in mind. If you have any feature requests, please vote or submit them on our [roadmap page](https://roadmap.inngest.com/roadmap).
