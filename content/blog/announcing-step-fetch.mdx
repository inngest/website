subtitle: Offload HTTP requests to the Inngest Platform to save compute and improve reliability.

We are thrilled to release [Fetch](/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows/fetch), a set of new APIs to make durable HTTP requests within an Inngest function.
Now available in our TypeScript SDK, the `step.fetch()` API and the `fetch()` utility enable you to make requests to third-party APIs or fetch data in a durable way by offloading them to the Inngest Platform.

Dealing with 3rd party API requests and data fetching comes with its sets of challenges, from handling rate limits to reliability and slow response times.
While Inngest Flow Control features such as [Throttling](/docs/guides/throttling) or [Concurrency](/docs/guides/concurrency) help with the first two, the Fetch APIs now close the loop with a simple way to
make all HTTP requests durable and performant on any compute platform.

```typescript
const processFiles = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "process-files" },
  { event: "files/process" },
  async ({ step }) => {
    // the request is offloaded to the Inngest Platform
    const response = await step.fetch("https://api.example.com/files", {
      method: "GET",
      headers: {
        "Authorization": `Bearer ${process.env.API_KEY}`
      }
    })

    // your Inngest function get resumed here with the response
    await step.run("process-file", async (file) => {
      const body = await response.json()
      // body.files
    })
  }
)
```

Both APIs offload the HTTP request to the Inngest Platform, freeing up more capacity for your service to handle other incoming requests:

## `step.fetch()` in a nutshell

The new `step.fetch()` API brings all the benefits of `step.run()` with the added benefit of offloading the HTTP request to the Inngest Platform,
saving you compute and removing potential Serverless timeout issues.

Being part of the `step` API, `step.fetch()` is alo compatible with `Promise` API, enabling you to perform multiple requests in parallel and use the `Promise.all()` API to speed up your functions:

```typescript
const processFiles = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "process-files", concurrency: 10 },
  { event: "files/process" },
  async ({ step, event }) => {
    // All requests will be offloaded and processed in parallel while matching the concurrency limit
    const responses = await Promise.all(event.data.files.map(async (file) => {
      return step.fetch(`https://api.example.com/files/${file.id}`)
    }))

    // your Inngest function get resumed here with the responses
    await step.run("process-file", async (file) => {
      const body = await response.json()
      // body.files
    })
  }
)
```

All `step.fetch()` (and `fetch()` helper) calls appear in your Inngest Traces, improving observability and helping you debug issues with your HTTP requests:

## Inngest's `fetch()` utility: a durable `fetch` for all platforms

The Fetch APIs also exposes a `fetch()` utility that works exactly like the native `fetch()` API but is compatible with the `step.fetch()` API.

Inngest's `fetch()` utility can be passed as a custom fetch handle to make all axios request durable:

```typescript
import { fetch } from "inngest";

const api = new MyProductApi({ fetch });
```

The `fetch()` utility is context aware and will choose to fallback to the native `fetch()` API if it is not running within an Inngest function:

```typescript
import { fetch } from "inngest";

const api = new MyProductApi({ fetch });

// A call outside an Inngest function will fall back to the global fetch
await api.getProduct(1);

// A call from inside an Inngest function will be made durable and offloaded to the Inngest Platform
inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "my-fn" },
  { event: "product/activated" },
  async () => {
    await api.getProduct(1);
  },
);
```

## Get started

Inngest's `fetch()` and `step.fetch()` APIs are available in our TypeScript SDK.

Get started by reading the [Fetch documentation](/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows/fetch) and by checking out the [examples](/docs/examples/fetch).

`step.fetch()` is a unique feature that tackles complex use cases while improving the developer experience. Take a [look and participate in our roadmap](https://roadmap.inngest.com/roadmap?ref=footer) as we continue to push the limits of Inngest's APIs!
