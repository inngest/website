Since launching Insights, we've heard consistent feedback: querying Events is useful, but you need easier access to schemas, and the ability to share queries across your team.

Today, we're shipping two new features that make Insights significantly more powerful for debugging and observability.

## **Schema explorer**

Writing Insights queries meant context-switching: common schema fields required navigating to docs, event-specific schemas required navigating elsewhere in the app. Not ideal when you're trying to write a query quickly.

The new schema explorer lives in a panel on the right side of the Insights page. It surfaces both common fields and event-specific schemas inline, with search and pagination. No more tab-hopping to remember field names.

## **Shared queries**

Good queries shouldn't live in one person's head. Now you can share queries with your organization directly in the app.

Shared queries show up for everyone in your org, complete with attribution ("Last edited by X at Y"). You can deep-link to specific queries, making it easy to bookmark common debugging queries or share them in Slack when an incident kicks off.

For teams onboarding new engineers, shared queries serve as reference implementations, new folks can see how others in the org are using Insights before writing their own.

## **Get started**

These features are available now in the Inngest dashboard. Head to Insights and start exploring schemas inline, and sharing your first query with your team.
