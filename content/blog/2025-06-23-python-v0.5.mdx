We are thrilled to announce the release of the Inngest Python SDK v0.5. This release brings a number of new features and improvements to the SDK, including:

- [First-class Pydantic support in step and function output](#pydantic)
- [Experimental AI orchestration with `step.infer`](#ai-orchestration)
- [Connect is stable](#connect)
- [Python 3.13 support](#python-313)
- [Event-sending retries](#event-sending-retries)
- [Function singletons](#function-singletons)
- [Function timeouts](#function-timeouts)
- [Improved parallel step performance](#improved-parallel-step-performance)

# New features

## Pydantic

Pydantic is a popular library for runtime data validation and serialization. Inngest now supports Pydantic models as step and function output. You can read more about Pydantic support in the [Pydantic guide](/docs/reference/python/guides/pydantic).

First, ensure that the Pydantic serializer is set on the Inngest client:
```py
client = inngest.Inngest(
    app_id="my-app",
    serializer=inngest.PydanticSerializer(),
)
```

Then you can specify the `output_type` parameter for `step.run`:

```py
class User(pydantic.BaseModel):
    name: str

async def get_user() -> User:
    return User(name="Alice")

@client.create_function(
    fn_id="my-fn",
    trigger=inngest.TriggerEvent(event="my-event"),
)
async def my_fn(ctx: inngest.Context) -> None:
    # user object is a Pydantic object at both runtime and compile time
    user = await ctx.step.run("get-user", get_user, output_type=User)
```

If you want to return a Pydantic object from a function, you can set the `output_type` parameter on the function:

```py
@client.create_function(
    fn_id="my-fn",
    output_type=User,
    trigger=inngest.TriggerEvent(event="my-event"),
)
async def my_fn(ctx: inngest.Context) -> None:
    return User(name="Alice")
```

## AI orchestration

The Python SDK now supports the same `step.ai.infer` AI orchestration as the TypeScript SDK. You can read more about AI orchestration in the [AI orchestration guide](/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows/step-ai-orchestration).

```py
import inngest
from inngest.experimental import ai

@inngest_client.create_function(
    fn_id="hello-world",
    trigger=inngest.TriggerEvent(event="say-hello"),
)
async def hello(ctx: inngest.Context) -> object:
    res = await ctx.step.ai.infer(
        "say-hello",
        adapter=ai.anthropic.Adapter(
            auth_key="sk-ant-000000",
            model="claude-3-5-sonnet-latest",
        ),
        body={
            "max_tokens": 1024,
            "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}],
        },
    )
    return res["content"][0]["text"]
```

Note that AI orchestration is still experimental. We feel that it's ready for production use, but the interface may change.

## Connect

Connect is now stable. The feature is still in developer preview across all languages, but the Python API is stable. You can read more about Connect in the [Connect guide](/docs/setup/connect).

## Python 3.13

Python 3.13 is now supported. Note that Python 3.9 is no longer supported.

## Event-sending retries

Whenever an event is sent using our client or `step.send`, the SDK will now retry the request if it fails. Idempotency is automatic, so you don't need to worry about duplicate events.

## Function singletons

Function singletons are now supported. You can read more about function singletons in the [function singletons guide](/docs/guides/singleton).

## Function timeouts

Function timeouts are now supported. You can read more about function timeouts in the [function timeouts guide](/docs/features/inngest-functions/cancellation/cancel-on-timeouts).

## Improved parallel step performance

The number of requests required to perform parallel steps is reduced by up to 50%.
