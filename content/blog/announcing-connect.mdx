While Inngest has been primarly successful among Serverless developers, we've seen a growing demand from developers running Inngest Functions on their long-running servers such as Render, AWS EC2, DigitalOcean and such.
Additionally, some customers scaling large applications with Inngest were also looking for a lower latency and better support for long-running functions.

After a few weeks of private alpha, we are happy to rollout Connect as a [Developer Preview](/docs/release-phases#developer-preview) in our TypeScript, Python and Go SDKs.

[Connect](/docs/setup/connect) is drop-in replacement to [`serve()`](/docs/learn/serving-inngest-functions) to connect your application to Inngest over one or multiple outbound persistent connections, **dramatically improving the latency and scalability of your functions**.


This new deployment method relying the [WebSocket protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket#:~:text=WebSocket%20is%20a%20computer%20communications,as%20RFC%206455%20in%202011.) brings:

<Col>
- **Lower latency** - No need for multiple HTTP requests to Inngest to process a single function.
- **Elastic horizontal scaling** - Easily add more capacity by running additional workers.
- **Ideal for container runtimes** -  Deploy on Kubernetes or ECS without the need of a load balancer for inbound traffic
- **Simpler long running steps** - Step execution is not bound by platform http timeouts.

Beyond huge performance and scalability benefit, Connect also brings a better developer experience, **enabling colocate all your Inngest-related code in a single file**:


```ts
import { Inngest } from 'inngest'
import { connect } from 'inngest/connect';
import { ConnectionState } from 'inngest/components/connect/types';

const inngest = new Inngest({
  id: 'my-app'
});

const handleSignupFunction = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: 'handle-signup' },
  { event: 'user.created'}
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    console.log('Function called', event);
  }
);

(async () => {
  const connection = await connect({
    apps: [{ client: inngest, functions: [handleSignupFunction] }]
  });

  console.log('Worker: connected', connection);
})();
```

_Find examples in Go and Python in the [Connect documentation page](/docs/setup/connect)_


Once your application deployed using Connect, each active connection get listed as workers in the Inngest Platform, bringing you full visibility
on your application health and load:

Beyond observability, Connect also brings a finer control over production deployments with supports for rollbacks, rolling releases and more.


## Get started with Connect

If your application is running on servers, or if you are looking for a finer horizontal scaling control or lower latency, give Connect a try and [share your feedback during our developer preview](/discord)!

The [Connect documentation](/docs/setup/connect) will drive you from setup to advanced deployment configuration ðŸš€
