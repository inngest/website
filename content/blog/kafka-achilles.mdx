You're part of a small team building a resume parser for a large job-matching platform. The goal is simple: parse resumes, score candidates, and notify them of relevant job listings.

Your team picks Kafka for its speed, low latency, and strong community support. But what starts as a straightforward pipeline: parse → score → notify,  quickly spirals into a tangle of retries, deduplication logic, and Redis patches.

Suddenly, you're not shipping features, you're maintaining infrastructure.

 
While building the resume parser with Kafka, your team has three key goals:

1. **Prioritize** newly submitted resumes over background jobs
2. **Avoid reprocessing** unchanged resumes to save compute costs
3. **Rate limit** requests to a third-party parsing API to avoid throttling or surprise bills

Simple requirements… in theory.

To implement them, you set up Kafka and Redis: using Redis to cache recent resume hashes for deduplication, storing timestamps to rate limit API calls per user, and tracking submission IDs to simulate prioritization by filtering consumer logic.

![Implementing Flow Control with Kafka requires Redis as a state store along with its associated coordination logic.](/assets/blog/kafka-achilles/illustration.png)

At first, it seems manageable. But soon your team realizes you're spending more time stitching Kafka and Redis together, and  end up writing **custom coordination logic** (e.g., deduplicating/rescheduling messages, rate limiting per user), then fighting **race conditions** when multiple consumers grab similar jobs at once, and finally **managing retries, visibility, and weird edge cases** by hand, building delay/retry topics, dead-letter queues, and lots of logging just to keep the pipeline stable.

### Coordination logic (Redis dedupe + per-user rate limit)

```jsx
// ioredis ^5, kafkajs ^2
import Redis from "ioredis";
const redis = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL);

// Deduplicate: only process a resume hash once per 10 minutes
export async function shouldProcess({ resumeUrl, version }) {
  const key = `dedupe:${Buffer.from(`${resumeUrl}:${version}`).toString("base64url")}`;
  // NX = set only if not exists; EX = TTL seconds
  return Boolean(await redis.set(key, "1", "EX", 600, "NX"));
}

// Rate limit: allow N calls per user per window
export async function underLimit(userId, limit = 3, windowSec = 3600) {
  const key = `ratelimit:user:${userId}`;
  const n = await redis.incr(key);
  if (n === 1) await redis.expire(key, windowSec);
  return n <= limit;
}
```

### Prevent race conditions (simple distributed lock)

```jsx
// Distributed locking pattern with Redis
import crypto from "node:crypto";
import Redis from "ioredis";
const redis = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL);

// Acquire a lock, run fn, then safely release
export async function withLock(lockKey, ttlMs, fn) {
  const token = crypto.randomUUID();
  const ok = await redis.set(lockKey, token, "PX", ttlMs, "NX");
  if (!ok) return { acquired: false };

  try {
    const result = await fn();
    return { acquired: true, result };
  } finally {
    // Release only if we still own the lock (Lua CAS)
    const lua = `
      if redis.call("get", KEYS[1]) == ARGV[1] then
        return redis.call("del", KEYS[1])
      else return 0 end
    `;
    await redis.eval(lua, 1, lockKey, token);
  }
}

// Usage
// const { acquired } = await withLock(`lock:submission:${id}`, 30000, () => doWork());
```

### Manual retries, backoff, DLQ (KafkaJS)

```jsx
// Initialize Kafka client and consumers
import { Kafka } from "kafkajs";
const kafka = new Kafka({ clientId: "svc", brokers: process.env.KAFKA_BROKERS.split(",") });
const producer = kafka.producer();
const consumer = kafka.consumer({ groupId: "resumes-v1" });

// Retry configuration
const MAX_RETRIES = 5;
const nextBackoffMs = (a) => Math.min(60_000, Math.round((2 ** a) * 500 * (0.5 + Math.random())));

// Send message to retry topic with exponential backoff
async function sendToRetry(msg, attempt) {
  await producer.send({
    topic: "resumes.retry",
    messages: [{
      key: msg.key?.toString(),
      value: msg.value?.toString(),
      headers: { ...msg.headers, attempt: String(attempt), availableAt: String(Date.now() + nextBackoffMs(attempt)) },
    }],
  });
}

// Send message to dead-letter queue when max retries reached
async function sendToDLQ(msg, reason) {
  await producer.send({
    topic: "resumes.dlq",
    messages: [{ key: msg.key?.toString(), value: msg.value?.toString(), headers: { ...msg.headers, error: String(reason).slice(0, 200) } }],
  });
}

// Delay worker to requeue when availableAt is reached
async function runDelayWorker() {
  const retryConsumer = kafka.consumer({ groupId: "resumes-delay" });
  await Promise.all([producer.connect(), retryConsumer.connect()]);
  await retryConsumer.subscribe({ topic: "resumes.retry" });

  await retryConsumer.run({
    eachMessage: async ({ message }) => {
      const due = Number(message.headers?.availableAt || "0");
      const wait = Math.max(0, due - Date.now());
      if (wait) await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, Math.min(wait, 30_000)));
      await producer.send({ topic: "resumes", messages: [{ key: message.key, value: message.value, headers: message.headers }] });
    },
  });
}

// Main consumer with visibility + retry handling
async function runConsumer(processFn) {
  await Promise.all([producer.connect(), consumer.connect()]);
  await consumer.subscribe({ topic: "resumes" });

  await consumer.run({
    eachMessage: async ({ message }) => {
      const attempt = Number((message.headers?.attempt || "0").toString());
      try {
        await processFn(JSON.parse(message.value.toString()), message);
      } catch (err) {
        if (attempt + 1 >= MAX_RETRIES) await sendToDLQ(message, err.message || "unknown");
        else await sendToRetry(message, attempt + 1);
      }
    },
  });
}
```

Now you're explaining to the PM why a 5-minute delay” would take a sprint to implement

The infrastructure you hoped would speed you up is now slowing you down.

Growing frustrated with the complexity, one of your engineers starts looking for a simpler solution. After some research, they stumble across Inngest's Flow Control .

[Flow Control](/docs/guides/flow-control) in Inngest lets you manage **how and when your functions run**. You can control things like **resource usage** (CPU, concurrency), **event execution order**, how functions behave in a **queue**, and **how often** they run per event.

The team realizes that everything the team was trying to build manually, rate limiting, deduplication, retries, and prioritization, is already handled natively within Inngest.

So instead of stitching together Kafka consumers and Redis keys, they can use declarative primitives like:

**Debounce** to avoid duplicate processing

Prevent duplicate resumes from being parsed within a short window:

```jsx
export default inngest.createFunction(
{
  id: "handle-webhook",
  debounce: {
    key: "event.data.resume_id",
    period: "5m",
    timeout: "10m",
  },
},
{ event: "user/resume.updated" },
async ({ event, step }) => {
  // This function will only be scheduled 5 minutes after events are no longer received with the same
  // `event.data.resume_id` field.
  //
  // `event` will be the last event in the series received.
}
);
```

### **Throttle** to control API usage

Limit how frequently a user can trigger expensive operations:

```jsx
export default inngest.createFunction(
{
  id: "unique-function-id",
  throttle: {
    limit: 1,
    period: "5s",
    burst: 2,
    key: "event.data.user_id",
  },
},
{ event: "jobs/job_posts" },
async ({ event, step }) => {
  // This function will only allow 1 request every 5 seconds per user_id
  // with a burst allowance of 2 requests
}
);
```

### **Built-in durability, retries, and observability**

No need to write retry logic or track state, Inngest handles all of that automatically. If a step fails, it retries with backoff. If a user uploads multiple resumes, you can cancel previous runs. And you get full visibility into every workflow with step-by-step logs.

With Flow Control , what once required a distributed system of Kafka, Redis, and coordination code becomes a simple, maintainable function that just works, and scales.

Now the team no longer has to worry about patching Redis logic, writing custom retry handlers, or managing Kafka infrastructure. They can finally focus on what actually matters: building a great product.

The team is shipping faster. Bugs related to duplicate resume processing have disappeared. API usage has dropped thanks to built-in throttling. Product managers can now suggest changes or new features without it turning into a full sprint of Kafka reconfigurations. 

Kafka is powerful, no doubt, but for most teams, especially those building product workflows, it's too much. You end up writing glue code, managing extra infrastructure, and solving problems that have already been solved a hundred times.

Inngest's [Flow Control](/docs/guides/flow-control)  gives you those same capabilities, **without the overhead**. You get [retries](/docs/features/inngest-functions/error-retries/retries), [rate limiting](/docs/guides/debounce), [debouncing](), [throttling](/docs/guides/throttling), [prioritization](/docs/guides/priority), and more,  all built-in, all configurable, and all production-ready.

So if you're spending more time managing queues than delivering features, maybe it's time to ask a better question:

**What if your event-driven architecture didn't need to be this hard?**
