It's now even easier for Vercel users to get started with Inngest. Inngest is now available to all on the Vercel Marketplace. This combines our seamless integration with features like branch environments that exists today with unified billing to your Vercel account.

## Here's what Inngest brings to your Vercel project

### AI workflows and agent orchestration

Inngest enables developers to create stateful AI workflows on Vercel's serverless functions. Use Inngest's flexible SDK to define workflows using “steps” that chain LLM calls, database operations, and tool calling. Inngest handles the orchestration of long-running workflows by automatically splitting up execution across one or more serverless invocations then combining the responses into a single cohesive result.

Try out our [AgentKit](https://agentkit.inngest.com/?ref=blog-vercel-marketplace) SDK with Inngest to make building AI agents that reason, research, and route work to other agents.

### Handle failures with automatic retries

Every Inngest function is automatically retried to gracefully handle issues including the occasional error, third-party API outages, or flaky LLM responses. Inngest's [durable execution engine](/docs/learn/how-functions-are-executed?ref=blog-vercel-marketplace) ensures that only the failed steps are re-run and successful ones are never run again.

### Realtime updates

Use Inngest's [Realtime feature](/docs/features/realtime?ref=blog-vercel-marketplace) to push or stream data from your workflows running in the background to the browser to build interactive applications and show status updates. Quickly add this with [our React hooks and Next.js examples](/docs/features/realtime/react-hooks?ref=blog-vercel-marketplace).

### Branch environments

Inngest automatically creates a new, isolated environment for every Vercel preview deployment. This means that every member of your team gets a completely isolated full-stack test environment for every pull request. Branch environments are created instantly, on-demand whenever you deploy your Vercel project. [Learn more about branch environments](/docs/platform/environments#branch-environments?ref=blog-vercel-marketplace).

## Setting up Inngest

If you don't already have an Inngest account, head to [the Inngest page in Vercel Marketplace](https://vercel.com/marketplace/inngest). Click “Install” and agree to the terms and conditions.

Next you'll be able to select the billing plan and the included usage for each plan (more info on our plans below). Here we've selected the Pro plan which starts at $75 per month with additional charges for executions above the included amount.

On the next screen, you'll give your project a name. We suggest something that matches your project or company. Then click “Continue” to complete your Inngest account setup!

Now that you've created your Inngest account, it's time to connect Inngest to one of your Vercel projects. Here you'll find useful “Getting started” information including how to connect Inngest to a Vercel project as well as set up Inngest in your codebase.

To connect a project, you can either select the “Projects” tab or click the “Connect Project” button on the getting started guide section like in the video below.

Follow the rest of the Getting started guide and when you next deploy your project to Vercel, your [app will automatically sync with Inngest](/docs/platform/manage/apps?ref=blog-vercel-marketplace) and functions will be ready to be triggered! You can always open the Inngest dashboard by clicking the “**Open in Inngest**” button at the top right.

## Unified billing through Vercel

Our new Marketplace integration unifies your billing via your Vercel account. At end of each month, your account will be billed for your subscription and any additional usage beyond the included executions. There are two billing plans to select from

- **Hobby ($0/month)** - Great for side projects and proofs of concepts. Get started with Inngest for free! Includes 100k monthly executions and 25 concurrently running steps.
- **Pro ($75/month)**- Ideal for production use cases with higher included usage (1M executions) and additional concurrency (100 concurrent steps). The Pro plan also includes extended history and observability. Additional usage beyond 1M executions will be added to your invoice at the end of each month.

## Getting started

Any Vercel user can get started by visiting Inngest in the Vercel Marketplace [here](https://vercel.com/marketplace/inngest).
