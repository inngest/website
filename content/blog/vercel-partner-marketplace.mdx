It's now even easier for Vercel users to get started with Inngest. We're excited to announce Inngest is now available on the Vercel Marketplace. This combines our seamless integration with features like branch environments with unified billing to your Vercel account.

## Here's what Inngest brings to your Vercel project

### AI workflows and agent orchestration

Inngest enables developers to build stateful AI workflows using Vercel’s serverless functions. With Inngest's flexible SDK, you can define workflows using [“steps”](/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows?ref=blog-vercel-marketplace) that chain together LLM calls, database operations, and tool executions. Inngest handles the orchestration of long-running workflows by automatically splitting execution across multiple serverless invocations and combining the results into a single cohesive response.

Try our [AgentKit](https://agentkit.inngest.com/) SDK with Inngest to build AI agents that reason, research, and route work to other agents.

### Handle failures with automatic retries

Every Inngest function is automatically retried to gracefully handle issues including the occasional error, third-party API outages, or flaky LLM responses. Inngest's [durable execution engine](/docs/learn/how-functions-are-executed?ref=blog-vercel-marketplace) ensures that only failed steps are re-run, while successful ones are never repeated.

### Realtime updates

Use Inngest's [Realtime feature](/docs/features/realtime?ref=blog-vercel-marketplace) to stream data from background workflows to the browser, enabling interactive applications and live status updates. Easily integrate it using our [our React hooks and Next.js examples](/docs/features/realtime/react-hooks?ref=blog-vercel-marketplace).

### Branch environments

Inngest automatically creates a new, isolated environment for every Vercel preview deployment, giving each team member a completely isolated full-stack test environment for every pull request. Branch environments are created instantly and on-demand whenever you deploy your Vercel project. [Learn more about branch environments](/docs/platform/environments?ref=blog-vercel-marketplace#branch-environments).

## Setting up Inngest

If you don't already have an Inngest account, head to [the Inngest page in Vercel Marketplace](https://vercel.com/marketplace/inngest). Click “Install” and agree to the terms and conditions.

Next you'll be able to select the billing plan and the included usage for each plan (more info on our plans below). Here we've selected the Pro plan which starts at $75 per month with additional charges for executions above the included amount.

On the next screen, you'll give your project a name. We suggest something that matches your project or company. Then click “Continue” to complete your Inngest account setup!

Now that you've created your Inngest account, it's time to connect Inngest to one of your Vercel projects. Here you'll find useful “Getting started” information including how to connect Inngest to a Vercel project as well as set up Inngest in your codebase.

To connect a project, you can either select the “Projects” tab or click the “Connect Project” button on the getting started guide section like in the video below.

Follow the rest of the Getting started guide and when you next deploy your project to Vercel, your [app will automatically sync with Inngest](/docs/platform/manage/apps?ref=blog-vercel-marketplace) and functions will be ready to be triggered! You can always open the Inngest dashboard by clicking the “**Open in Inngest**” button at the top right.

## Unified billing through Vercel

Our new Marketplace integration unifies billing through your Vercel account. At the end of each month, your account is charged for your subscription and any additional usage beyond the included executions. You can choose from two billing plans.

- **Hobby ($0/month)** - Great for side projects and proofs of concepts. Get started with Inngest for free! Includes 100k monthly executions and 25 concurrently running steps.
- **Pro ($75/month)**- Ideal for production use cases with higher included usage (1M executions) and additional concurrency (100 concurrent steps). The Pro plan also includes extended history and observability. Additional usage beyond 1M executions will be added to your invoice at the end of each month.

## Getting started

Any Vercel user can get started by visiting Inngest in the Vercel Marketplace [here](https://vercel.com/marketplace/inngest).
