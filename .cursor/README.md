# Cursor Configuration Files

This directory contains helpful configuration and reference files for using Cursor AI to develop this website.

## Files

- **`.cursorrules`** (in project root) - Main configuration file that Cursor AI reads automatically. Contains project overview, conventions, and guidelines.

- **`QUICK_REFERENCE.md`** - Quick reference guide with common commands, file locations, and troubleshooting tips.

- **`EXAMPLES.md`** - Code examples showing common patterns for creating pages, components, and working with the codebase.

## How to Use

When you ask Cursor AI to help with this project, it will automatically read `.cursorrules` to understand the project structure and conventions. You can also reference the other files for quick answers to common questions.

## For Non-Technical Users

If you're new to coding or this project:

1. **Start with `.cursorrules`** - It explains what the project is and how it works
2. **Use `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`** - When you need to know where to put files or what commands to run
3. **Check `EXAMPLES.md`** - When you need to see how to write code for common tasks

## Tips

- Ask Cursor AI specific questions like "How do I add a new blog post?" or "Where should I put a new component?"
- Reference these files when you're unsure about project conventions
- The `.cursorrules` file helps Cursor AI give you better, more context-aware suggestions
