# Message Queue vs. Message Bus

Understand when to use a message queue vs a message bus

</Header>

## What is a Message Queue

A message queue receives events, buffers them, and allows a worker to read from the queue to process the events. This enables you to implement things like ordering, coupling, and retries.

## What is a Message Bus

A message bus (or, message broker, event bus, or event broker) accepts events to be received by other services. Within a message bus, you send events to a "topic" rather than a queue which is then received by one or more services. This enables you to implement fan-out, delivery guarantees, real-time distribution, and scale

## Simplified Message Brokers and Queues with Inngest

Inngest is an application reliability layer for developers building AI-based apps. It combines an event stream, queues, and durable execution into a single layer to make it easier for you to build more complex flows.

### How It Works

When you send events to Inngest via HTTP, they are received by a broker which processes the event. Step functions are then scheduled to run via a queue. This means you can fan-out from one event and run many functions, and you can also aggregate and stream all events from your systems to build out async logic.

TODO do we have a short video demo of this??
