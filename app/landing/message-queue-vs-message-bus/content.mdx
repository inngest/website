# Message Queue vs. Message Bus

Understand when to use a message queue vs a message bus

</Header>

## What is a Message Queue

A message queue receives events, buffers them, and allows a worker to read from the queue to process the events. This enables you to implement things like ordering, coupling, and retries.

## What is a Message Bus

A message bus (or, message broker, event bus, or event broker) accepts events to be received by other services. Within a message bus, you send events to a "topic" rather than a queue which is then received by one or more services. This enables you to implement fan-out, delivery guarantees, real-time distribution, and scale

## Simplified Message Brokers and Queues with Inngest

Inngest is an application reliability layer for developers building AI-based apps. It combines an event stream, queues, and durable execution into a single layer to make it easier for you to build more complex flows.

### How It Works

When you send events to Inngest via HTTP, they are received by a broker which processes the event. Step functions are then scheduled to run via a queue. This means you can fan-out from one event and run many functions, and you can also aggregate and stream all events from your systems to build out async logic.

### See It In Action

```typescript
const createSummary = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "create-conversation-summary", concurrency: { limit: 10 } },
  { event: "thread/message.sent" }
  async (event) => {
    // business logic to create a summary via LLM
  }
);
const createSummary = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "send-notifications" },
  { event: "thread/message.sent" }
  async (event) => {
    // business logic to send email notifications to users
  }
);
// In your API endpoint
async function POST(req) {
  const message = await db.messages.create(req.body);

  // ⬇️ This event triggers both functions to run, each with their own queue:
  await inngest.send({ name: "thread/message.sent", data: message });

  return Response.json({ success: true }, { status: 200 });
}
```
