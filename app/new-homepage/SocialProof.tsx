        I've worked on workflow systems before and am consistently amazed with
        the <AtInngest /> team's ability to do them better than anyone else. it
        takes me a few lines of app code to do things that would've been huge
        projects for an entire team in past jobs, largely due to work like this

        Today @listedBApp says goodbye to Kafka and I couldn't be more excited
        to be replacing it with <AtInngest />. Not every day do you get to
        replace a major infra component that improves DX, saves money and
        enables faster innovation :rocket:

        For anyone who is building multi-step AI agents (e.g AutoGPT type
        systems), I highly recommend building it on top of a job queue
        orchestration framework like <AtInngest />, the traceability these
        things provide out of the box is super useful, plus you get timeouts &
        retries for free.

        I think the game has changed with <AtInngest />.
        <br />
        <br />
        To me, it is the missing piece for making a JS/TS a serious backend
        contender.
        <br />
        <br />
        It has queuing, rate limits, backoff, & everything else you named,
        without needing to muck around with SQS. 10/10 recommend

        Headache prevented by <AtInngest /> and their concurrency feature ðŸ¤¯
        <br />

        This function potentially runs for a long time and this allows us to not
        run this function again when the previous function hasn't finished based
        on the combination specified in 'key'.

        Highly recommended, super simple to set up and amazing DX.

        Behind every successful generative AI product, there are queues and

        I love this product so much! I spent 2 days setting up some background
        workers on Render.com and it was a total pain in the ass. I gave up and
        I got my background jobs set up in under 10 minutes with Inngest.
