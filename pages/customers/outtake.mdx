Outtake is a cybersecurity platform leveraging always-on AI agents to scan millions of digital surface areas (webpages, app store listings, ads, and more) per minute to detect and dismantle digital impersonations. Its innovative approach drastically reduces manual labor for enterprise security teams, shrinking threat remediation timelines from weeks to minutes and helping counter millions in fraud losses. Through real-time threat classification and automated response, Outtake is transforming digital security and supercharging organizations in protecting their online identities at Internet scale.

## The challenge of context engineering: scanning millions of domains and webapps daily.

Human oversight alone is no longer enough to keep pace with today's AI-driven cyber threats. Attackers now spin up convincing clones of enterprise websites in minutes,deploying fake login, checkout, and support pages at scale to trick users and steal their credentials. Outtake counters this with 24/7 protection. By embedding AI agents throughout its system, Outtake continuously hunts, classifies, and remediates attacks without ticket backlogs. A core component of their system's architecture is Inngest, ensuring Outtake's models get the right data, in the right format, at the right moment. That precision enables complex security tasks to be handled autonomously, keeping clients and users safe online.

Outtake leverages a **comprehensive [multi-step](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/multi-step-functions) context-building pipeline** implemented through Inngest. The primary objective of this system is to recognize and counter **harmful impersonations across the Internet**.

<div className="w-11/12 flex-col self-center">

Outtake systematically scans **the digital landscape, spanning search engines, domains, websites, and forums, to uncover unstructured data that may signal threats.** This information flows through advanced detection pipelines designed to detect identity attacks. Outtake's AI agents classify abuse types ranging from sophisticated phishing and impersonation to intellectual property violations. Guided by each client's brand guidelines, IP policies, and enforcement preferences, the agents automatically take actions to remediate threats.

Building a system of this complexity, with hundreds of data sources with autonomous AI-focused workflows layered on top means managing massive swings in compute while ensuring rock-solid  reliability:

> There are **so many limits to juggle in such a variety of places. We face them on the incoming side in terms of datasource building and on the agentic side in terms of token usage**.  Further in any complex workflow, AI agents can behave unpredictably as we configure our systems. If those issues surface without control, they can quickly disrupt progress. **Having fine-grained control over errors and how they propagate is incredibly valuable. Function invocations are just as important. Our pipelines are intricate, with many interdependent components and their own concurrency challenges, all chained together.**

Outtake overcomes these challenges with Inngest's powerful workflows and  Flow Control features:

- **[Durable workflows](https://www.inngest.com/uses/durable-workflows)** help Outtake's data and AI pipelines recover seamlessly from external interruptions,  resuming workflows from the last successful checkpoint.  This not only conserves resources but also accelerates processing.
- **[Throttling](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/throttling)** manages the load of incoming data streams by spreading them out over time, thereby preventing managing scale limits intelligently.
- **[Batching](https://www.inngest.com/docs/guides/batching)** speeds up Outtake's processing of millions of daily events, grouping similar information to reduce compute and database load.

## Inngest: Outtake's Event-Driven Core

Outtake's powerful threat scanning engine leverages Events, yet another key feature of Inngest.

Built on an event-driven architecture, Outtake leverages powerful patterns, including batching, debouncing, and event replay, to ensure that automated security workflows run smoothly. Inngest's highly reliable Event API ensures that every sent event is persisted, serving as the durability  layer of Outtake's processing steps:

> **Our agents reason and act on millions of datapoints at once.** With Inngest, we can queue up millions of events without worrying about loss or disruption. That reliability is everything.

With events' guaranteed reliability and availability, Inngest's [Replay](https://www.inngest.com/docs/platform/replay) feature gives Outtake a powerful way to maintain continuity when workflows are interrupted:  

> Replays and error handling are so critical. Being able to **replay functions is incredibly useful because outcomes can be unpredictable.** Whether it's an **outage** or data inconsistency somewhere that affects function runs, having the ability to retry that work ensures we process everything end-to-end without  **missing a thing.**

## Building AI Agents with Inngest

Outtake's approach demonstrates that **effective AI agents require a robust architecture to handle large datasets, manage rate limits, and ensure reliability**. Using Inngest's workflows, throttling, and event-driven design, Outtake developed a cybersecurity system that processes hundreds of thousands of digital attack surfaces daily without missing a single threat.
