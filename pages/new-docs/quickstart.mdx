# Quickstart

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the Protocol API. We'll cover how to get started using one of our API clients and how to make your first API request. We'll also look at where to go next to find all the information you need to take full advantage of our powerful REST API. {{ className: 'lead' }}

This quick start walks you step-by-step through everything you need to get started.  It'll take approximately 5 minutes.  You will learn how to:

- Run Inngest on your machine for local testing
- Add Inngest to an existing Next.js project ([other frameworks are also supported](/docs/frameworks))
- Write your first function
- Trigger your function from the development UI
- Trigger your function from code

Afterwards you'll be ready to [deploy your app to any platform](/docs/deploy), then build [advanced functions using our guides](/docs/guides)!  Let's get started.

## 1. Run Inngest locally

Before integrating Inngest we will start the [open-source development server](https://www.github.com/inngest/inngest).  Run the following command in your terminal:

You should see the following output:

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ language: 'js' }}
$ npx inngest-cli@latest dev

12:38PM INF runner > starting event stream backend=inmemory
12:38PM INF executor > starting queue backend=inmemory
12:38PM INF devserver > autodiscovering locally hosted SDKs
12:38PM INF executor > service starting
12:38PM INF coreapi > service starting
12:38PM INF devserver > service starting
12:38PM INF executor > subscribing to function queue
12:38PM INF runner > starting queue backend=inmemory
12:38PM INF coreapi > starting server addr=0.0.0.0:8300
12:38PM INF api > starting server addr=0.0.0.0:8288
12:38PM INF runner > initializing scheduled messages len=0
12:38PM INF runner > service starting
12:38PM INF runner > subscribing to events topic=events

        Inngest dev server online at 0.0.0.0:8288, visible at the following URLs:

          - http://127.0.0.1:8288 (http://localhost:8288)
```

</CodeGroup>

This runs Inngest locally.  We'll use this to test our functions as we write them.  With this running you can visit `http://localhost:8288` to see the development UI:
## Making your first API request

After picking your preferred client, you are ready to make your first call to the Protocol API. Below, you can see how to send a GET request to the Conversations endpoint to get a list of all your conversations. In the cURL example, results are limited to ten conversations, the default page length for each client.

<CodeGroup tag="GET" label="/v1/conversations">

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
curl -G https://api.protocol.chat/v1/conversations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -d limit=10
```

```js
import ApiClient from '@example/protocol-api'

const client = new ApiClient(token)

await client.conversations.list()
```

```python
from protocol_api import ApiClient

client = ApiClient(token)

client.conversations.list()
```

```php
$client = new \Protocol\ApiClient($token);

$client->conversations->list();
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button
    href="/conversations"
    variant="text"
    arrow="right"
    children="Read the docs for the Conversations endpoint"
  />
</div>

## What's next?

Great, you're now set up with an API client and have made your first request to the API. Here are a few links that might be handy as you venture further into the Protocol API:
