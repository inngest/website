# Quick start

Inngest enables you to XYZ. 

This five-minute tutorial will walk you through setting up and running Inngest on your machine. You will write your first function and trigger it from code and your app's UI.

Let's get started.

## Choose a framework:

<GuideSelector
  options={[
    { key: "nextappdir", title: "Next.js - App Router" },
    { key: "nextpages", title: "Next.js - Pages Router" }
  ]}>

## Prerequisite: choose a project to which you'll add Inngest

You can choose any existing Next.js project or create a new one.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Create a new Next.js project</strong></summary>

 Run the following command in your terminal to create a new Next.js project:

<GuideSection show="nextpages">
```shell
npx create-next-app@latest --ts --eslint --tailwind --no-src-dir --no-app --import-alias='@/*' inngest-guide
```
</GuideSection>

<GuideSection show="nextappdir">
```shell
npx create-next-app@latest --ts --eslint --tailwind --src-dir --app --import-alias='@/*' inngest-guide
```
</GuideSection>

</details>

Open the project in your code editor and start the Next.js development server in your terminal by running:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Let's now add Inngest.

## 1. Install Inngest

With your development server running, open a new tab in your terminal. In your project directory's root, run the following command to install Inngest JavaScript SDK:

<CodeGroup>
```shell {{ title: "npm" }}
npm install inngest
```
```shell {{ title: "yarn" }}
yarn add inngest
```
```shell {{ title: "pnpm" }}
pnpm add inngest
```
</CodeGroup>

## 2. Run Inngest dev server

Next, start the Inngest development server:

```
npx inngest-cli@latest dev
```

<details>
  <summary><strong>You should see a similar output:</strong></summary>

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ language: 'js' }}
$ npx inngest-cli@latest dev

        Inngest dev server online at 0.0.0.0:8288, visible at the following URLs:

          - http://127.0.0.1:8288 (http://localhost:8288)
```

</CodeGroup>

</details>

In your browser open [`http://localhost:8288`](http://localhost:8288) to see the development UI where you will test the functions you write:

  className="max-w-2xl rounded-md"
/>

## 3. Create an Inngest client

Now it's time to create an [Inngest client](/docs/reference/client/create) in your Next.js project. You will use it to send and receive events. Inngest runs your functions securely via an API endpoint at `/api/inngest`.

<GuideSection show="nextpages">
  Create a new file at `./pages/api/inngest.ts` with the following code:

  ```ts {{ filename: "pages/api/inngest.ts" }}
  import { Inngest } from "inngest";
  import { serve } from "inngest/next";

  // Create a client to send and receive events
  export const inngest = new Inngest({ id: "my-app" });

  // Create an API that serves zero functions
  export default serve({
    client: inngest,
    functions: [
      /* your functions will be passed here later! */
    ],
  });
  ```
</GuideSection>

<GuideSection show="nextappdir">
  Make a new directory next to your `app` directory (for example, `src/inngest`) where you'll define your Inngest functions and client.

  In this directory create an Inngest client:

  ```ts {{ filename: "src/inngest/client.ts" }}
  import { Inngest } from "inngest";

  // Create a client to send and receive events
  export const inngest = new Inngest({ id: "my-app" });
  ```

## 4. Create an API handler

Now you will set up the API endpoint for hosting and invoking functions. 

Add a route handler within your app directory (for example, at `src/app/api/inngest/route.ts`) to handle the `/api/inngest` endpoint:

  ```ts {{ filename: "src/app/api/inngest/route.ts" }}
  import { serve } from "inngest/next";
  import { inngest } from "../../../inngest/client";

  // Create an API that serves zero functions
  export const { GET, POST, PUT } = serve({
    client: inngest,
    functions: [
      /* your functions will be passed here later! */
    ],
  });
  ```
</GuideSection>

<Callout>
üëâ Note that you can import [`serve()`](/docs/reference/serve) for other frameworks but the code, in fact, is the same ‚Äî only the import statement changes.
</Callout>

## 5. Write your first Inngest function

In this step, you will write your first reliable serverless function.

### Define the function

To define the function, use the [`createFunction`](/docs/reference/functions/create) method, which takes three arguments:
  - Configuration: `id` is required and is the name of your function, which is used in the Inngest dashboard to identify the function.
  - Trigger: `event` is the name of the event that triggers your function. Alternatively, you can also use `cron` to specifiy a schedule to trigger this function.
  - Handler: the function that is called when the event is received (or, what is supposed to happen when the Trigger happens).


<GuideSection show="nextpages">

Add the following code to the `./pages/api/inngest.ts` file:

  ```ts
  // Step 2 code...
  const helloWorld = inngest.createFunction(
    { id: "hello-world" },
    { event: "test/hello.world" },
    async ({ event, step }) => {
      await step.sleep("wait-a-moment", "1s");
      return { event, body: "Hello, World!" };
    },
  );
  ```
  
</GuideSection>

<GuideSection show="nextappdir">

  Create the following function in your new `inngest` directory at `src/inngest/functions.ts`:

  ```ts {{ filename: "src/inngest/functions.ts" }}
  import { inngest } from "./client";

  export const helloWorld = inngest.createFunction(
    { id: "hello-world" },
    { event: "test/hello.world" },
    async ({ event, step }) => {
      await step.sleep("wait-a-moment", "1s");
      return { event, body: "Hello, World!" };
    },
  );
  ```

</GuideSection>

### Add the function to `serve()`

<GuideSection show="nextpages">

  Next, add this new Inngest function to the `serve` handler.

  ```ts
  export default serve({
    client: inngest,
    functions: [
      helloWorld, // <-- This is where you'll always add your new functions
    ],
  });
  ```

</GuideSection>

<GuideSection show="nextappdir">

  Next, add this new Inngest function to the `serve` handler so Inngest can invoke it via HTTP:

  ```ts {{ filename: "src/app/api/inngest/route.ts" }}
  import { serve } from "inngest/next";
  import { inngest } from "../../../inngest/client";
  import { helloWorld } from "../../../inngest/functions";

  export const { GET, POST, PUT } = serve({
    client: inngest,
    functions: [
      helloWorld, // <-- This is where you'll always add your new functions
    ],
  });
  ```

</GuideSection>

Now, time to run your function!

## 6. Triggering your function from the development UI

<details>
  <summary><strong>Inngest's key feature are events.</strong></summary>

Event-driven architecture allow you to:
- Run one or many functions automatically
- See the event payload, and use the event payload in your functions
- Store the event for some amount of time, to locally replay if there are errors in production
- Build complex sleeps and schedules without worrying about queues
</details>

You will see an event firing in practice first by sending it directly to Inngest UI.

With your Next.js and Inngest dev servers running, head to Inngest's [`http://localhost:8288`](http://localhost:8288).

<img
  src="/assets/docs/quick-start/dev-server-empty-stream.jpg"
  width="720" height={720/1800*1218} quality="95"
  className="max-w-2xl rounded-md"
/>

To send the event, click on ‚ÄúTest Event‚Äù in the top right corner. Add the data from the `createFunction` you defined earlier:

```json
{
  "name": "test/hello.world",
  "data": {
    "email": "test@example.com"
  }
}
```

<img
  src="/assets/docs/quick-start/dev-server-send-event.jpg"
  width="720" height={720/1800*1218} quality="95"
  className="max-w-2xl rounded-md"
/>

The event is sent to Inngest (which is running locally) and automatically runs your function in the background!

<img
  src="/assets/docs/quick-start/dev-server-stream.jpg"
  width="800" height={800/2762*1868} quality="95"
  className="rounded-md"
/>

<img
  src="/assets/docs/quick-start/dev-server-stream-details.jpg"
  width="800" height={800/2762*1868} quality="95"
  className="rounded-md"
/>

In the next step, you will trigger events from your app.

## 7. Triggering from code

When you want to run functions reliably in your app, you'll need to send an event to Inngest. Once an event is received, it is forwarded to all functions that listen to it.

<details>
  <summary><strong>To send an event from your code, you can use the `Inngest` client's `send()` method.</strong></summary>

With the `send` method used above you now can:
- Send one or more events within any API route.
- Include any data you need in your function within the `data` object.

In a real-world app, you might send events from API routes that perform an action, like registering users (for example, `app/user.signup`) or creating something (for example, `app/report.created`).

</details>

You will now send an event from the ‚Äúhello‚Äù Next.js API function that you can create in the <GuideSection show="nextpages">`./pages/api/hello.ts`</GuideSection><GuideSection show="nextappdir">`src/app/api/hello/route.ts`</GuideSection> file:

<GuideSection show="nextpages">
  ```ts
  import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
  import { inngest } from "./inngest";

  // Opt out of caching; every request should send a new event
  export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";

  // Create a simple async Next.js API route handler
  export default async function handler(
    req: NextApiRequest,
    res: NextApiResponse,
  ) {
    // Send your event payload to Inngest
    await inngest.send({
      name: "test/hello.world",
      data: {
        email: "testFromNext@example.com",
      },
    });

    res.status(200).json({ name: "Hello Inngest from Next!" });
  }
  ```
</GuideSection>
<GuideSection show="nextappdir">
  ```ts
  import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
  import { inngest } from "../../../inngest/client"; // Import our client

  // Opt out of caching; every request should send a new event
  export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";

  // Create a simple async Next.js API route handler
  export async function GET() {
    // Send your event payload to Inngest
    await inngest.send({
      name: "test/hello.world",
      data: {
        email: "testFromNext@example.com",
      },
    });

    return NextResponse.json({ name: "Hello Inngest from Next!" });
  }
  ```
</GuideSection>

<Callout>
üëâ Note that we use [`"force-dynamic"`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching) to ensure we always send a new event on every request. In most situations, you'll probably want to send an event during a `POST` request so that you don't need this config option.
</Callout>

Every time this API route is requested, an event is sent to Inngest. To test it, open http://localhost:3000/api/hello (change your port if your app is running elsewhere). You should see XYZ.

Congratulations! You now have learned how to use Inngest by creating functions and sending events to trigger those functions.
