# Self-hosting

We currently do not support self-hosting at this point in time.

We're making rapid changes to the system to accommodate customer requests, and it's simply not sustainable to make sure
the system work across all releases, and provide migration guides for it.

However, we're aware of the demand for self-hosting, and we're tracking the request in our [roadmap][roadmap].

If this is something of interest to you, please provide feedback there.
