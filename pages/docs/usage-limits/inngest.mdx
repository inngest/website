# Usage Limits

We have put some limits on the service to make sure we provide you a good default to start with, while also keeping it a good experience for all other users using Inngest.

Some of these limits are customizable, so if you need more than what the current limits provide, please [contact us][contact] and we can update the limits for you.

## Functions

The following applies to `step` usage.

### Sleep duration

Sleep (with `step.sleep()` and `step.sleepUntil()`) up to a year, and for free plan up to seven days. Check the [pricing page](/pricing) for more information.

### Timeout

Each step has a timeout depending on the hosting provider of your choice ([see more info][provider-docs]), but Inngest supports up to `2 hours` at the maximum.

### Concurrency <Tag>Upgradable</Tag>

Concurrency limits the number of steps that can execute simultaneously. Check your current limits on the [billing page](https://app.inngest.com/billing). See the [pricing page](/pricing?ref=docs-usage-limits-concurrency) for more info about the concurrency limits in all plans.

<Callout>
**Important:** Concurrency limits _step_ execution, not the total number of function runs. Functions that are sleeping, waiting for events, or paused between steps do **not** count against your concurrency limit.
</Callout>

When you reach your concurrency limit, additional steps are queued and will execute as capacity becomes available. If your functions appear to "stall" or steps take longer than expected, you may be hitting your concurrency limit.

**To diagnose and resolve concurrency issues:**
- **In production:** Monitor your usage in the [metrics dashboard](https://app.inngest.com) and consider upgrading your plan
- **In local development:** Increase queue workers with `--queue-workers` flag (default: 100)
- See the [concurrency troubleshooting guide](/docs/guides/concurrency#troubleshooting-concurrency-issues) for detailed guidance

### Payload Size

The limit for data returned by a step is `4MB`.

### Function run state size

Function run state cannot exceed `32MB`. Its state includes:
- Event data (multiple events if using batching)
- Step-returned data
- Function-returned data
- Internal metadata (_small - around a few bytes_)

### Number of Steps per Function

The maximum number of steps allowed per function is `1000`.

<Callout>
  ⚠️
  This limit is easily reached if you're using `step` on each item in a loop.
  Instead we recommend one or both of the following:
  - Process the loop within a `step` and return that data
  - Utilize the [fan out][fanout-guide] feature to process each item in a separate function
</Callout>

## Events

### Name length

The maximum length allowed for an event name is `256` characters.

### Request Body Size <Tag>Upgradable</Tag>

The maximum event payload size is dependent on your billing plan. The default on the Free Tier is `256KB` and is upgradable to `3MB`. See [the pricing page](/pricing?ref=docs-usage-limits) for additional detail.

### Number of events per request <Tag>Customizable</Tag>

Maximum number of events you can send in one request is `5000`.
If you're doing fan out, you'll need to be aware of this limitation when you run `step.sendEvent(events)`.

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: "TypeScript" }}
// this `events` list will need to be <= 5000
const events = [{name: "<event-name>", data: {}}, ...];

await step.sendEvent("send-example-events", events);
// or
await inngest.send(events);
```

```go {{ title: "Go" }}
// this `events` list will need to be <= 5000
events := []inngestgo.Event{{Name: "<event-name>", Data: {}}}

ids, err := client.SendMany(ctx, events)
```

```python {{ title: "Python" }}
# this `events` list will need to be <= 5000
events = [{'name': '<event-name>', 'data': {}}, ...]

await step.send_event('send-example-events', events)
# or
await inngest.send(events)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Batch size

The hard limit of a batch size is 10 MiB regardless of the `timeout` or `maxSize` limit.
Meaning the batch will be started if that limit is crossed even if the batch is not full or has not reached the timeout duration configured.
