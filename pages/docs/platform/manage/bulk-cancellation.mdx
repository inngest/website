# Function runs Bulk Cancellation

In addition to providing [SDK Cancellation features](/docs/features/inngest-functions/cancellation/cancel-on-events) and a [dedicated REST API endpoint](/docs/guides/cancel-running-functions), the Inngest Platform also features a Bulk Cancellation UI.

This feature comes in handy to quickly stop unwanted runs directly from your browser.

## Cancelling Function runs

To cancel multiple Function runs, navigate to the Function's page on the Inngest Platform and open the “All actions” top right menu:

![](/assets/docs/platform/manage/bulk-cancellation/function-runs-cancel-button.png)

Clicking the “Bulk cancel” menu will open the following modal, asking you to select the date range that will be used to select and cancel Function runs:

The Bulk Cancellation will cancel the matching Function runs immediately; the Function runs list will update progressively, showing runs as cancelled:

You can access the history of running or completed Bulk Cancellation processes via the "Cancellation history" tab:

**Considerations**

Cancellation is useful to stop running Functions or cancel scheduled ones; however, keep in mind that:

- Steps currently running on your Cloud Provider won't be forced to stop; the Function will cancel upon the current step's completion.
- Cancelling a Function run does not prevent new runs from being enqueued. If you are looking to mitigate an unwanted loop or to cope with an abnormal number of executions, consider using Function Pausing.
