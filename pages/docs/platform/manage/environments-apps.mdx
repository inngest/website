# Environments & Apps

Inngest enables you to manage your Inngest Functions deployments via [Inngest Environments and Apps](/docs/apps). Inngest Environments (ex, production, testing) can contain multiple Apps that can be managed using:

- [The Apps Overview](#apps-overview) - A quick access to all apps, including the unattached syncs
- [Syncs management](#syncs) - Run App diagnostics and access all syncs history
- [Archiving](#archive-an-app) - Archive inactive Apps


## Apps Overview

The Apps Overview is the main entry page of the Inngest Platform, listing the Apps of the active Environment, visible in the top left Environment selector:

The Apps Overview provides all the essential information to assess the healthy sync status of your active Apps: Functions identified, Inngest SDK version. You can switch to ‚ÄúArchived Apps‚Äù using the top left selector.

### Unattached Syncs

Automatic syncs or an App misconfiguration can result in syncs failing to attach to an existing app.

These unsuccessful syncs are listed in the ‚ÄúUnattached Syncs‚Äù section where detailed information are available, helping in resolving the issue:

Please read our [Syncs Troubleshooting section](/docs/apps/cloud#troubleshooting) for more information on how to deal with failed sync.

## App management

### Overview

Navigating to an App provides more detailed information (SDK version and language, deployment URL) that can be helpful when interacting with our Support.

You will also find quick access to all active functions and their associated triggers:

### Syncs

The Inngest Platform regularly sends requests to your app (syncs) to stay updated with the deployed functions and their configuration. At any time, access the history of all syncs to inspect the changes detected by the Inngest Platform:

If you feel like the Inngest Platform missed an update on your side, go back to the App Overview and try triggering a ‚ÄúResync‚Äù. If the issue persists, try running an App Diagnostic before reaching out to Support:

### Archive an app

Apps can be archived and unarchived at any time. Once an app is archived, all of its functions are archived.

When the app is archived:

- New function runs will not be triggered.
- Existing function runs will continue until completion.
- Functions will be marked as archived, but will still be visible, including their run history.

If you need to cancel all runs prior to completion, read our [cancellation guide](/docs/guides/cancel-running-functions).

**How to archive an app**

1. Navigate to the app you want to archive. You will find an ‚ÄúArchive‚Äù button at the top-right corner of the page.

2. Confirm that you want to archive the app by clicking "Yes".

3. Your app is now archived. üéâ
