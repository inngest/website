# Inspecting a Function run

You identified a failed Function run and want to identify the root cause? Or simply want to dig into a run's timings?
The Function run details will provide all the information to understand how this run ran and the tools to reproduce it locally.

## Accessing Function runs

Functions runs across all application of the currently [selected environment](/docs/platform/environments) are accessible via the "Runs" menu in the left side navigation.

![The "Handle failed payments" Function runs list features a run in a failing state.](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/inspecting-function-runs/function-runs.png)

_Runs can be filtered using a Status, Queued or Started at and Application filters._

Accessing the runs of a specific Function is achieved via the "Functions" menu, as described in the following section.

## The Function run details

A _Handle failed payments_ function failed after retrying 5 times:


![The "Handle failed payments" Function runs list features a run in a failing state.](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/inspecting-function-runs/handle-failed-payments-function-run-failed.png)

Clicking on the failed Function Runs expands the run detail view:

![The Function run details view displays the event payload on the left, some technical attributes (function version, timings) on the right and a timeline of steps on the bottom left.](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/inspecting-function-runs/function-run-logs.png)

The Function run details panel is divided in 3 parts:

- On the top right: the **Trigger details** helpful when exchanging with Support
- On the right: the **Event payload** that triggered the Function run
- On the bottom right: the **Run details** with its timeline, a clear with of the Function's steps execution


The Function run details informs us that our Function run failed because of an `Error: Failed to downgrade user` error.

This is a first clue, let's have a closer look at the Timeline to identify the root cause:

We can now spot that the `downgrade-account-billing-plan` failed.

Let's expand this step to look at the retries and errors.

Expanding a step provides the same level of details (the error message and timings) along with retries information.

It seems that our `downgrade-account-billing-plan` step raised the same error during the following 5 retries, we might have to perform a fix in the database.

It is useful for Function having a lot of steps or retries!

## Performing actions from the Function run details

The Function run details provides two main actions: replay the Function Run or sending the trigger event to your local Inngest Dev Server.

Sending the trigger Event to your local Inngest Dev Server provides a quick way to reproduce issues that are not linked to external factors (ex: new function version recently deployed, data issues).

After looking at the Function run details, the failure is judged temporary or fixed by a recent deployment, you can replay the Function run by using the "Rerun" button at the top right of the screen.

![The rerun button is accessible in the header of the "run details" section of the Function run detail](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/inspecting-function-runs/function-runs-details-open-new-tab.png)
