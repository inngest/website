# Searching for Events

Inngest's Engine matches [trillions of events everyday](https://www.inngest.com/blog/accidentally-quadratic-evaluating-trillions-of-event-matches-in-real-time), powering features such as [Cancellation](/docs/features/inngest-functions/cancellation/cancel-on-events), [Concurrency](/docs/guides/concurrency) and [Batching](/docs/guides/batching) keys.

The Inngest Platform provides an Event Search feature to help you navigate through all your events.

You can access the Event Search from the Events page:

## Writing an Event Search query

The Event Search relies on [a CEL expression](/docs/guides/writing-expressions), already used in the Inngest SDK to match events when ["waiting for events"](/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows/wait-for-event) or writing a [custom concurrency key](/docs/guides/concurrency).

Considering the following `"billing/payment.failed"` events list:

![The "billing/payment.failed" is composed of three data attributes: "billingPlan", "paymentId", and "reason". We will use the event name and billingPlan attributes to narrow down Enterprise payment failures.](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/searching-events/payment-events.png)

Let's narrow down events of failed Enterprise payments using the `event.name == 'billing/payment.failed' && event.data.billingPlan == 'Enterprise'` query:

![We enter the query in the search bar and click on the associated "search" button. A list of matching events is now displayed below the search bar.](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/searching-events/payment-events-search.png)

**Searching events tips**

- The search only returns events from the last 3 days
- The query is case sensitive
- Logical operators are written using `&&` and `||`, not words
- String values should be provided with single quotes, ex: `event.name == 'billing/payment.failed'`
