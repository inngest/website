# Observability & Metrics


With hundreds to thousands of events going through your Inngest Apps, triggering multiple Function runs, getting a clear view of what is happening at any time is crucial.

The Inngest Platform provides observability features for both Events and Function runs, coupled with Event logs and [a detailed Function Run Logs to inspect arguments and steps timings](/docs/platform/monitor/inspecting-function-runs).

## Events observability

Events volume and which functions they trigger can become hard to visualize.

Thankfully, the Events page gives you a quick overview of the volume of Events going through your Apps:

Get more detailed metrics for a dedicated event by navigating to it from the list:

## Event Metrics and Logs

The Event page helps quickly visualize the throughput (the rate of event over time) and functions associated with this event.

The event occurrences feature a “Source” column, which is helpful when an event is triggered from multiple Apps (ex, using different languages):

Clicking on a specific event will redirect you to its Logs.

The Event Logs view provides the most precise information, with the linked Function run and raw event data.

Such information, combined with the ability to forward the event to your Local Dev Server instance, makes debugging events much quicker:

## Function runs observability

The Functions list page provides the first round of essential information in one place with:

- **Triggers**: Events or CRON schedule
- **Failure** rate: enabling you to quickly identify a surge of errors
- **Volume**: helping in identifying possible drops in processing

Navigating to a Function displays an overview composed of three main parts:

1. KPIs - on the top
2. Metrics - at the center
3. Configuration - on the right

### Function KPIs

The Function KPIs are composed of two essential numbers for the selected time range (_default to 24h_):

<Row>

<Col>

- **Volume**: the number of Function runs
- **Failure rate**: the number of Functions runs that failed after reaching their maximum retry policy
</Col>
<Col>

</Col>

</Row>

Those two numbers are a good representation of the state of your application that might indicate some actions to take:

- A sudden Volume increase might require updating your Function configuration (ex: Throttling)
- A Volume at zero might suggest that some events stopped from being sent
- A high failure rate might be linked to a recent deployment or an external outage

### Function Metrics

The Function overview page showcases many charts featuring metrics that can help you better understand the overall performance of your Inngest Functions.

**Function Runs**

![](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/observability-metrics/function-metrics-runs.png)

The Function Runs charts provide a snapshot of the number of finished Function runs in buckets (from 1 minute to 1 hour).

<Callout variant="info">

**How to use this chart?**

You can leverage this chart to identify a possible recurrence or surge in failures or cancellations that might have affected the total volume for the active time range.

**Function Throughput**

**Step Running & Step Backlog  - Point in Time**

![](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/observability-metrics/function-metrics-step-backlog.png)
![](/assets/docs/platform/monitor/observability-metrics/function-metrics-step-running.png)

Both charts represents Step activity at a given point in time. Unlike other charts present on this page, these charts are not
aggregating the number of running or started steps in a given time bucket.

<Callout variant="info">

**How to use these charts?**

The _Step Backlog_ and _Step Running_ charts are helpful to assess the configuration of your Inngest Functions.

For example, a low _Function Throughput_ might be linked to a high number of concurrent steps combined with a too restrictive concurrency configuration.

**SDK Request Throughput**

### Function Configuration


<Row>

<Col>
The Function Configuration right panel is meant to be used as a reference for the KPIs and Function Metrics.

Updating your Function's retry configuration can solve a high failure rate. Also, increasing your Function's concurrency can help deal with Function Throughput issues.
