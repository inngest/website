# Deployment

Moving to production requires deploying your Inngest Functions on your favorite Cloud Provider and configuring it to allow the Inngest Platform to orchestrate runs: 


<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Deploy with Vercel" icon={<VercelIcon />} href={'/docs/deploy/vercel'}>
    Send an event from your applicationâ€™s backend with the Inngest SDK.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Deploy with Cloudflare Pages" icon={<CloudflareIcon />} href={'/docs/deploy/cloudflare'}>
    Run an Inngest function periodically with a trigger using cron syntax.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Deploy with Netlify" icon={<NetlifyIcon />} href={'/docs/deploy/netlify'}>
    Use Inngest as a webhook consumer for any service to trigger functions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Deploy your application" icon={<CloudIcon fill={'black'} />} href={'/docs/apps/cloud#sync-a-new-app-in-inngest-cloud'}>
    Directly invoke other functions to compose more powerful functions.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How Inngest handles deployments


The Inngest Platform hosts the Inngest Durable Execution Engine, responsible for triggering and maintaining the state of Function runs happening on your Cloud Provider:

<ImageTheme
  dark={'/assets/docs/platform/deployment/Durable-Execution-Engine-triggers-overview-dark.jpg'}
  light={'/assets/docs/platform/deployment/Durable-Execution-Engine-triggers-overview-light.jpg'}
  className="my-0"
  alt={''}
/>

The Inngest Platform relies on [Event](/docs/events/creating-an-event-key) and [Signing Keys](/docs/platform/signing-keys), as well as [other security mechanisms](/docs/learn/security), to communicate securely and reliably with the Inngest SDK.

Learn more on Inngest's Durable Execution Engine in our ["How Inngest Functions are executed" guide](/docs/learn/how-functions-are-executed).
