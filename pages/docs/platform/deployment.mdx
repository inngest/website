# Deployment

Moving to production requires deploying your Inngest Functions on your favorite Cloud Provider and configuring it to allow the Inngest Platform to orchestrate runs:

  <Card title="Deploy on any platform or runtime" icon={<CloudIcon fill={'black'} />} href={'/docs/apps/cloud#sync-a-new-app-in-inngest-cloud'}>
    Inngest Functions can be deployed to any serverless cloud or container running on any server.

    Use our Vercel Integration to deploy your Inngest Functions.

## How Inngest handles Function Runs


The Inngest Platform hosts the Inngest Durable Execution Engine, responsible for triggering and maintaining the state of **Function runs happening on your Cloud Provider**:

  light={'/assets/docs/platform/deployment/Durable-Execution-Engine-triggers-overview-light.jpg'}
  className="my-0"
  alt={'The Inngest Platform communicates with your deployed Inngest Functions by sending requests to your application.'}
/>

The Inngest Platform relies on [Event](/docs/events/creating-an-event-key) and [Signing Keys](/docs/platform/signing-keys), as well as [other security mechanisms](/docs/learn/security), to communicate securely and reliably with the Inngest SDK.

Learn more on Inngest's Durable Execution Engine in our ["How Inngest Functions are executed" guide](/docs/learn/how-functions-are-executed).
