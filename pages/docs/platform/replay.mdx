# Replay functions

Function runs that have ended can be replayed in bulk from the Inngest Dashboard. This is useful for
when you have a large number of runs that you want to replay, for example, if you had a bug in your
function that you have now fixed.

To replay a function, click the replay button which is present on both the function runs page and
the function replay page. This will open a modal where you can select the runs you want to replay.

You need to provide a replay name, which will be used to identify the replay in the replay list.
To select the runs to be replayed, provide a time range during which the runs were ended and specify
which status(es) they ended with.

Once you have selected the runs you want to replay, click the replay button to start the replay. You
will be redirected to the replay page where you can see the progress of the replay.

A replay will run until all the selected runs have been replayed. This doesn't happen all at once.
Instead, the replay will spread the load over time.
