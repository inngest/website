# Migrate from Mergent

As [Mergent](https://mergent.co/) transitions its focus, we recommend migrating your background jobs, workflows, and event-driven systems to Inngest, a modern developer platform purpose-built for reliable, scalable background functions and workflows.

When you migrate to Inngest, the execution still happens on your own servers (whether that's serverless or actual servers).  We manage the orchestration, queueing, and function state â€” meaning migration is fast and easy.

This guide walks you through:

## Why migrate to Inngest

Inngest is more than a Mergent alternativeâ€¦ it's a next-generation workflow platform for modern developers, and it works everywhere â€” whether you're running on serverless or servers.  Using Inngest, you get a powerful suite of tools out of the box, with minimal setup:

- **Durable functions and resumable workflows:** Define long-running, resumable workflows with simple async/await syntax. No state machines, context juggling, or queues to manage.
- **Built in retries, replay, idempotency, and flow control:** Automatic retries, step isolation, and state persistence ensure workflows don't break â€” even during deploys or failures.
- **Local development & debugging tools:** Build and test locally with the Inngest Dev Server. Log, trace, and replay events for full observability.
- **Scalable by Default**: Inngest is built to handle hundreds of millions of runs, without managing new infra.

## Migrating to Inngest

Let's walk through how to migrate your Mergent background jobs to Inngest.

### 1. **Install Inngest SDK**

First, install the Inngest SDK for your environment:

```jsx
npm install inngest
```

### 2. **Initialize Inngest Client**

Create a file like `inngest.ts` to initialize the Inngest client:

```tsx
// inngest.ts
import { Inngest } from "inngest";

// Change your app name here
export const inngest = new Inngest({ name: "My App" });
```

### 3. **Convert Mergent Tasks to Inngest Functions**

In Mergent, you might define a cron or event-triggered job. In Inngest, you'll wrap this logic in a function like so:

```tsx
// jobs/sendEmail.ts
import { inngest } from "../inngest";

export const sendEmail = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "send-email", name: "Send Email" },
  // NOTE: This event triggers the send email function.  You send this event
  // whenver a user is created â€” we'll cover that next.
  { event: "app/user.created" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    const user = event.data;

    // ğŸ§  step.run ensures retryable, durable execution.
    // Read our docs for more info: https://innge.st/steps
    await step.run("Send welcome email", async () => {
      await sendEmailToUser(user.email); // your own function
    });
  }
);
```

### 4. Send events to trigger Inngest functions

In your application code, [you *send events to Inngest* to trigger functions](/docs/features/events-triggers):

```tsx
import { inngest } from "../inngest/client";

// This sends an event to Inngest, which triggers *every* function that listens
// to this event.  Each function gets a copy of the event.
await inngest.send({
  // The event name
  name: "app/user.created",
  // The event's data.
  data: {
    email: "test@example.com",
  },
});
```

You can also test your functions â€” including viewing function traces â€” in development using our dev server:

```tsx
npx inngest-cli@latest dev
```

### 5. **Deploy to Production**

Once you're ready, deploy your Inngest functions to your platform of choice (Vercel, Netlify, or a custom Node.js server). Inngest works seamlessly with serverless platforms and can also run inside any Express/Next.js app.  [Read the deployment docs here.](/docs/platform/deployment)

## Major differences

Inngest introduces several new concepts to improve reliability, performance, scale, and the developer experience compared to Mergent.  Here are a few things to be aware of:

### **Events & job scheduling**

In Mergent, you schedule jobs directly via an API.

In Inngest, you write self-contained **durable functions** using our SDK, deployed inside your application.  Each function declares how it runs (one or more events, or a cron).  You send events to Inngest, which automatically run all matching functions.

This allows you to:

- **Fan-out,** having one event trigger many functions
- **Replay events on failure**, in bulk
- **Wait for matching events,** in the middle of functions ([docs](/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows/wait-for-event))

### Cron schedules

In Mergent, cron schedules are defined in the dashboard or API with cron syntax.

In Inngest**, c**ron schedules are declared directly inside your function file:

```tsx
export const dailyReminder = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "daily-reminder" },
  { cron: "0 9 * * *" }, // Run daily at 9am UTC
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    await step.run("Send daily email", async () => {
      await sendEmail(event.data.email);
    });
  }
);
```

### **Retries & Durability**

In Inngest, functions are **durable** by default. Each step is atomic and automatically retried if it fails â€” even across deploys.

```tsx
await step.run("Some task", async () => {
  // This step will be retried if it fails
});
```
