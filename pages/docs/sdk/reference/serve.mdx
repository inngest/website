# Serve

The `serve()` handler is an HTTP handler that enables Inngest to remotely read your functions configurations and call your functions on-demand. This handler enables you to host your function code on any platform and have Inngest call them via HTTP.

An `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` is required to securely communicate with the Inngest platform, either via environment variable (_recommend_) or it can be passed explicitly through the options argument.

The `serve()` handler uses different HTTP request methods (`GET`, `PUT`, `POST`) to excute it's required actions.

## Reference

**`serve` syntax**

```typescript
serve(appName, [functions]);
serve(appName, [functions], options);
```

**`serve` arguments**

- **`appName`**:  The name of your app or microservice, used to group all functions together
- **`[functions]`**: An array of all functions to enable
- **`options`**: An optional object of options, with the type:

```ts
type Options = {
  /**
   * A key used to sign requests to and from Inngest in order to prove that the
   * source is legitimate.
   *
   * You must provide a signing key to communicate securely with Inngest. If
   * your key is not provided here, we'll try to retrieve it from the
   * `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` environment variable.
   *
   * You can retrieve your signing key from the Inngest UI inside the "Secrets"
   * section at {@link https://app.inngest.com/secrets}. We highly recommend
   * that you add this to your platform's available environment variables as
   * `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY`.
   *
   * If no key can be found, you will not be able to register your functions or
   * receive events from Inngest.
   */

   *
   *     "https://myapp.com"
   *

   * as the "Host" header and request path, but sometimes this isn't possible
   * (e.g. when running in a more controlled environments such as AWS Lambda or
   * when dealing with proxies/rediects).
   *
   * Provide the custom hostname here to ensure that the path is reported
   * correctly when registering functions with Inngest.
   *
   * To also provide a custom path, use `servePath`.
