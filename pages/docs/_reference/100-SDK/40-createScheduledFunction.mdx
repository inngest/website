The `createScheduledFunction` helper function or the `Inngest#createScheduledFunction` method can be used to define some code to run on a schedule. Coupled with a [`serve()` handler](/docs/reference/sdk/serve), this enables you to host scheduled functions on any platform and have Inngest trigger them via HTTP.

## Signature

```ts
(Inngest#)createScheduledFunction(nameOrOpts: string | FunctionOptions, cron: string, fn: Function): InngestFunction
```

## Parameters

Both signatures take the same set of parameters.

_A ? indicates an optional property._

- `nameOrOpts: string | FunctionOptions`<br/>If a `string`, will be the name of the function as it will appear in the Inngest Cloud UI. An object of options for the function can also be specified, seen below as [`FunctionOptions`](#functionoptions).
- `cron: string`<br/>The cron definition to schedule your function, e.g. `"0 0 * * *"` for the beginning of every day, or `"0 * * * *"` for every hour.
- `fn: Function`<br/>The sync or async code to run on the given schedule.

### `FunctionOptions`

A set of options for configuring the identity and behaviour of an Inngest function.

- `name: string`<br/>A name for the function as it will appear in the Inngest Cloud UI.<br/><br/>This is used to create a slugified ID for the function too, e.g. `"My FN :)"` would create a slugified ID of `"my-fn"`.<br/><br/>If you are not specifying an ID and get a warning about duplicate functions, make sure to explicitly set an ID for the duplicate or change the name.
- `id?: string`<br/>An optional unique ID used to identify the function. This is used internally for versioning and referring to your function, so should not change between deployments.<br/><br/>By default, this is a slugified version of the given `name`, e.g. `"My FN :)"` would be slugified to `"my-fn"`.<br/><br/>If you are not specifying an ID and get a warning about duplicate functions, make sure to explicitly set an ID for the duplicate or change the name.
- `idempotency?: string`<br/>Allow the specification of an idempotency key using event data. If specified, this overrides the `throttle` object.
- `throttle?: object`<br/>Throttle functions, only running them a given number of times (`count`) per `period`. This can optionally include a throttle `key`, which is used to further constraint throttling, similar to idempotency.
  - `key?: string`<br/>An optional key to use for throttling, similar to idempotency.
  - `count: number`<br/>The number of times to allow the function to run per the given `period`.
  - `period: string`<br/>The period of time to allow the function to run `count` times. Must be in the format of a "time string", e.g. `"1h30m"`.

## Returns

Every method to create a function will return an `InngestFunction` instance, which can be passed to any [`serve()` handler](/docs/reference/sdk/serve) to register the function with Inngest.

## Examples

Create a scheduled function that will log a message every hour.

```js
import { createScheduledFunction } from "inngest";

export default createScheduledFunction(
  "My Function",
  "0 * * * *",
  ({ event }) => {
    console.log("My scheduled function ran.");
  }
);
```

Create a function using an `Inngest` client.

```ts
import { Inngest } from "inngest";

const inngest = new Inngest({ name: "My App" });

export default inngest.createScheduledFunction(
  "My Function",
  "0 * * * *",
  ({ event }) => {
    console.log("My scheduled function ran.");
  }
);
```
