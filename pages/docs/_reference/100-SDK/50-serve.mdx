The `serve()` handler is an HTTP handler that enables Inngest to remotely read your functions configurations and call your functions on-demand. This handler enables you to host your function code on any platform and have Inngest call them via HTTP.

An `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` is required to securely communicate with the Inngest platform, either via environment variable (_recommend_) or it can be passed explicitly through the options argument.

The `serve()` handler uses different HTTP request methods (`GET`, `PUT`, `POST`) to excute it's required actions.

## How to use

There are multiple `serve()` handlers that can be imported from the SDK depending on your applicaiton's framework (e.g. `"inngest/next"`), but all have the same arguments and options. The handler should be accessible on it's own HTTP route in your app. We recommend setting this up for `/api/inngest`.

### Next.js

The Next.js handler should be set up to run as an API route ([reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)):

```typescript
// ./pages/api/inngest.js
import { serve } from "inngest/next";
import someFunction from "../../inngest/someFunction";
import anotherFunction from "../../inngest/anotherFunction";

export default serve("My App", [someFunction, anotherFunction]);
```

### Express.js

The Express handler should be passed to `app.use()` ([reference](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#app.use)) or `router.use()` ([reference](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#router.use)) to handle all HTTP methods:

```typescript
import { serve } from "inngest/express";
import someFunction from "../../inngest/someFunction";
import anotherFunction from "../../inngest/anotherFunction";

app.use("/api/inngest", serve("My App", [someFunction, anotherFunction]));
```

### Cloudflare Pages

The Cloudflare Pages handler should be exported with as the `onRequest` handler ([reference](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/#writing-your-first-function)):

```typescript
// ./functions/api/inngest.ts
import { serve } from "inngest/cloudflare";
import someFunction from "../../inngest/someFunction";
import anotherFunction from "../../inngest/anotherFunction";

export const onRequest = serve("My App", [someFunction, anotherFunction]);
```

## Reference

**`serve` syntax**

```typescript
serve(appName, [functions]);
serve(appName, [functions], options);
```

**`serve` arguments**

- **`appName`**:  The name of your app or microservice, used to group all functions together
- **`[functions]`**: An array of all functions to enable
- **`options`**: An optional object of options, with the type:

```ts
type Options = {
  /**
   * A key used to sign requests to and from Inngest in order to prove that the
   * source is legitimate.
   *
   * You must provide a signing key to communicate securely with Inngest. If
   * your key is not provided here, we'll try to retrieve it from the
   * `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` environment variable.
   *
   * You can retrieve your signing key from the Inngest UI inside the "Secrets"
   * section at {@link https://app.inngest.com/secrets}. We highly recommend
   * that you add this to your platform's available environment variables as
   * `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY`.
   *
   * If no key can be found, you will not be able to register your functions or
   * receive events from Inngest.
   */
  signingKey?: string;

  /**
   * Controls whether a landing page with introspection capabilities is shown
   * when a `GET` request is performed to this handler.
   *
   * Defaults to true if NODE_ENV !== production.
   *
   * This page is highly recommended when getting started in development,
   * testing, or staging environments.
   */
  landingPage?: boolean;

  /**
   * The URL used to register functions with Inngest.
   * Defaults to https://api.inngest.com/fn/register
   */
  inngestRegisterUrl?: string;

  /**
   * If provided, will override the used `fetch` implementation. Useful for
   * giving the library a particular implementation if accessing it is not done
   * via globals.
   *
   * By default the library will try to use the native Web API fetch, falling
   * back to a Node implementation if no global fetch can be found.
