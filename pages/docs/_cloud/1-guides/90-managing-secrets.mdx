Each Inngest account environment (Production & Test) has it's own secrets manager. All secrets are encrypted and are passed as environment variables to your functions at runtime.

## Adding a new secret

You can access the secrets manager by navigating to the **Settings** panel from the left navigation then selecting the **Secrets Manager** tab or clicking [this direct link](https://app.inngest.com/settings/secrets). You can then click "Add a secret" and enter your secret name and value.

## Using a secret

Secrets are passed in as environment variables using the name specified within Inngest.  For more information, [read the secrets documentation](/docs/functions/secrets).

## Production and Test environments

To toggle between production and test environments, use the "Test mode" toggle on the left navigation. Secrets are isolated to each environment.
