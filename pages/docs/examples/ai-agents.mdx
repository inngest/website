# AI Agents

AI agents are software entities that perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously based on predefined rules or machine learning models. These agents can be used in various scenarios, such as customer support, data analysis, and process automation, to enhance efficiency and productivity.

With Inngest, you can orchestrate and manage AI agents to create robust workflows that leverage AI capabilities seamlessly.

## Code examples
Here are apps that use Inngest to power AI agent workflows.
