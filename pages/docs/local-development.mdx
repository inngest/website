# Local development

Inngest's tooling makes it easy to develop your functions locally with any framework using the Inngest Dev Server.

The [Inngest Dev Server](/docs/dev-server) is a fully-featured local version of the [Inngest Platform](/docs/platform/deployment) enabling a seamless transition from your local development to feature, staging and production environments.

## Development Flow with Inngest

The Inngest Dev Server provides all the features available in the Inngest Platform, guaranteeing a smooth transition from local dev to production environments.

Developing with Inngest looks as it follows:

1. [Configure the Inngest SDK in your application](/docs/inngest-tour/1-setup-inngest)
2. [Connecting the Inngest Dev Server to your local application](/docs/inngest-tour/2-your-first-function)
3. Develop your Inngest Functions with [Steps](/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows), [Flow Control](/docs/guides/flow-control) and [more](/docs/features/inngest-functions)
5. _(Optional) - Configure Preview environments with [our Vercel Integration](/docs/deploy/vercel)_

  light={'/assets/docs/features/local-development/Durable-Execution-Engine-local-dev-light.jpg'}
  className="my-0"
  alt={''}
/>

**Moving to production environments (preview envs, staging or production)**

Deploying your application to preview, staging and production environments does not require any code change:

6. [Create an Inngest App](/docs/apps) on the Inngest Platform and [configure its Event and Signing Keys on your Cloud](/pages/docs/platform/clouds-setup).
7. Leverage the Inngest Platform to [manage](/docs/platform/manage) and [monitor](/docs/platform/monitor) Events and Function Runs

<ImageTheme
  dark={'/assets/docs/features/local-development/Durable-Execution-Engine-staging-prod-dark.jpg'}
  light={'/assets/docs/features/local-development/Durable-Execution-Engine-staging-prod-light.jpg'}
