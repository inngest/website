# Encryption middleware

Encryption middleware provides end-to-end encryption for events, step output, and function output. **Only encrypted data is sent to Inngest servers**: encryption and decryption happen within your infrastructure.

```py
import inngest
from inngest.experimental.encryption_middleware import EncryptionMiddleware

inngest_client = inngest.Inngest(
    app_id="my-app",
    middleware=[EncryptionMiddleware.factory("my-secret-key")],
)
```

The following data is encrypted by default:
- The `encrypted` field in `event.data`.
- `step.run` return values.
- Function return values.

## Changing the encrypted `event.data` field

By default, `event.data.encrypted` is encrypted. All other fields are sent in plaintext. To encrypt a different field, set the `event_encryption_field` parameter.

## Decrypt only mode

To disable encryption but continue decrypting, set `decrypt_only=True`. This is useful when you want to migrate away from encryption but still need to process older events.

## Fallback decryption keys

If you'd like to attempt decryption with multiple keys, set the `fallback_decryption_keys` parameter. This is useful when rotating keys, since older events may have been encrypted with a different key.

## Cross-language support

This middleware is compatible with our encryption middleware in our TypeScript SDK. Encrypted events can be sent from Python and decrypted in TypeScript, and vice versa.
