# Wait for event

Wait until the Inngest server receives a specific event.

If an event is received before the timeout then the event is returned. If the timeout is reached then `None` is returned.

```py
@inngest.create_function(
    fn_id="my_function",
    trigger=inngest.TriggerEvent(event="app/my_function"),
)
async def fn(
    ctx: inngest.Context,
    step: inngest.Step,
) -> None:
    res = await step.wait_for_event(
        "wait",
        event="app/wait_for_event.fulfill",
        timeout=datetime.timedelta(seconds=2),
    )
```
