# Create the Inngest Client

The `Inngest` client object is used to configure your application, enabling you to create functions and send events.

```ts
import { Inngest } from "inngest";

const inngest = new Inngest({
  name: "My application",
});
```

---

## Configuration

<Properties>
  <Property name="name" type="string" required>
    The unique name of your application
  </Property>
  <Property name="eventKey" type="string">
    An Inngest [Event Key](/docs/events/creating-an-event-key). Alternatively, set the `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY` environment variable.
  </Property>
  <Property name="env" type="string">
    The environment name. Required only when using [Branch Environments](/docs/platform/environments)
  </Property>
  <Property name="fetch" type="Fetch API compatible interface">
    Override the default [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) implementation. Defaults to the runtime's native Fetch API.
  </Property>
  <Property name="inngestBaseUrl" type="string">
    Override the default (`https://inn.gs/`) base URL for sending events.
  </Property>
</Properties>

<Callout>
We recommend setting the `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY` as an environment variable over using the `eventKey` option. As with any secret, it's not a good practice to hard-code the event key in your codebase.

## Defining Event Payload Types

You can leverage TypeScript to define your event payload types. When you pass types to the Inngest client, events are fully typed when using them with `inngest.send()` and `inngest.createFunction()`. This can more easily alert you to issues with your code during compile time.

<CodeGroup title="Defining Types" forceTabs={true}>
```ts
type Events = {
  "app/account.created": {
    name: "app/account.created",
    data: {
      userId: string;
    }
  },
  "app/subscription.started": {
    name: "app/subscription.started",
    data: {
      userId: string;
      planId: string;
    }
  }
}

export const inngest = new Inngest<Events>({ name: "My App" });
```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

### Share your client across your codebase

Instantiating the `Inngest` client in a single file and sharing it across your codebase is ideal as you only need a single place to configure your client and define types which can be leveraged anywhere you send events or create functions.

```ts  {{ filename: './inngest/client.ts' }}
import { Inngest } from "inngest";

export const inngest = new Inngest({ name: "My App" });
```

```ts  {{ filename: './inngest/myFunction.ts' }}
import { inngest } from "./client";

export default inngest.createFunction(...);
```
