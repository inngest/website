# Cancellation

```ts
inngest.createFunction(
  { name: "Sync contacts", cancelOn: [{ event: "app/user.deleted" }] }
  // ...
);
```

Provide an event that, upon receipt, will cancel the execution of a given function.

The API for this is similar to the [`step.waitForEvent()`](/docs/functions/multi-step#wait-for-event) tool, allowing you to specify the incoming event and different methods for matching pieces of data within.

## With timeout

Cancel a function's execution if a matching event is received within a given amount of time from the function being triggered.

```ts
inngest.createFunction(
  {
    name: "Sync contacts",
    cancelOn: [{ event: "app/user.deleted", timeout: "1h" }],
  }
  // ...
);
```

## Matching fields

Cancel a function's execution if value of the `data.userId` field on the incoming event matches the same field on the triggering event.

```ts
inngest.createFunction(
  {
    name: "Sync contacts",
    cancelOn: [{ event: "app/user.deleted", match: "data.userId" }],
  }
  // ...
);
```
