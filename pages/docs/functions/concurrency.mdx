# Concurrency

```ts
inngest.createFunction(
  { name: "Sync contacts", concurrency: 5 },
  // ...
);
```

Inngest can run many functions simultaneously; you can control the maxmimum concurrency with which they execute using the `concurrency` option when defining a function.

A value of `0`, `undefined`, or not providing the option means the maximum concurrency for your account will be used.

<Callout>
The current concurrency option controls the number of concurrent _steps_ that can be running at any one time.

Because a single function run can contain multiple steps, it's possible that more functions than the concurrency limit are triggered, but only the set number of steps will ever be running.
</Callout>

The maximum possible concurrency that can be set is based on your plan.
