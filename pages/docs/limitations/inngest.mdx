# Limitations

We have put some limits on the service to make sure we provide you a good default to start with, while also keeping it a good experience for all other users using Inngest.

Some of these limits are changable, so if the current limits are too low for you, please feel free to reach out and we can change the limits for you.

## Steps <Tag>Changable</Tag>

The maximum number of steps per function is 1000.

**Note**

This limit is easily reached if you're using `step` to loop through some list of items.
We recommend to process the loop within a `step` and return that data instead.

## Payload size <Tag>Changable</Tag>

**Event**

The limit for each event data is 512kB.

**Steps**

The limit for data returned by a step is 4MB.

## Events <Tag>Changable</Tag>

Maximum number of events per send is 5000.
If you're doing fan out, you'll need to be aware of this limitation when you run `step.sendEvent(events)`.

```typescript
// this `events` list will need to be <= 5000
const events = [{name: "<event-name>", data: {}}, ...];

step.sendEvent(events);
// or
inngest.send(events);;
```

## Execution time per step

The maximum amound of time we wait for a step to complete is 2 hours.
