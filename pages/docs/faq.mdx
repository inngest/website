## How do I run crons only in production?

There are multiple ways to achieve it:
1. Conditionally rendering depending on the environment.
```javascript 
process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? { cron: "* * *" } : { event: "dev/manualXYZ" }
```
ðŸ’¡ If you render an event instead of a cron in the other environments, you can still trigger your functions manually if needed.

2. [Disable branch environments](https://www.inngest.com/docs/platform/environments#disabling-branch-environments-in-vercel).

## Why am I getting â€œEvent key not found" errors in branch environments?
Branch environments are [automatically archived](https://www.inngest.com/docs/platform/environments#archiving-branch-environments) 3 days after their latest deploy.
It's possible to disable the auto archive functionality for each active environment on our [dashboard](https://app.inngest.com/env).


## How do I specify multiple serve paths for a same Vercel application on the dashboard?
You can pass multiple paths as comma-delimited values under the Vercel app in the [Vercel Integrationâ€™s settings](https://app.inngest.com/settings/integrations/vercel).

## What's the recommended way to redact data from step outputs?
We recommend doing [E2E encryption](https://www.inngest.com/docs/reference/middleware/examples#e2-e-encryption) instead, as it's more secure and plaintext data never leaves your servers.
