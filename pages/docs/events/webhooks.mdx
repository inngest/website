# Webhooks

In addition to [sending events via our SDK](/docs/events), you can also configure your any webhook to send data to Inngest.

Our Webhook feature, allows you to create a unique URL to start sending events to Inngest.

## Why use Inngest for webhooks?

When [building performant and scalable webhooks](/blog/building-webhooks-that-scale), the webhook endpoint needs to respond very quickly and then you need to be able to process that event asynchronously. Inngest is designed to do just this. There are also t

**Retries** - Sometimes processing of webhook events fails due to a networking blip or third party API outage. Inngest automatically retries your functions so you can be confident that your app is processing webhook data reliably.

**Event history & replay** - Often you need to understand what data has been sent from a third party webhook and inspect particular payloads to understand how your function's code may have failed. Inngest stores all inbound events and enables you to replay a particular event that may have failed. You can also copy this event payload and use it with the Inngest Dev Server to debug problems locally.

## Creating webhooks

You can create a new webhook within Inngest by heading to "Sources" and [selecting "Webhooks" tab](https://app.inngest.com/sources/new#Webhook).

When creating a webhook you will be prompted to give it a name and can optionally specify a transform and filter list. A transform allows you to change the event's structure before we process it, and filters allow you to allow or deny specific events or IPs from using the webhook.

## Transforms

Transforms allow you to change an incoming event's structure before we process it. Each event we process must match our [event format](/docs/event-format-and-structure) by having **at least** the `name` and `data` field. You can specify ES6+ [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) code which transforms an incoming event when creating a webhook.

The transform **must return an object containing a `name` and `data` field**:

```javascript
function transform(evt, headers = {}) {
  const name =
    headers["X-Github-Event"] || evt?.headers["X-Github-Event"] || "";
  return {
    // Use the event as the data without modification
    data: evt,
    // Add an event name, prefixed with "github." based off of the X-Github-Event data
    name: "github." + name.trim().replace("Event", "").toLowerCase(),
  };
}
```
The above example shows a GitHub transform, using the incoming event data to create a new `name` field.
You can use almost all ES6 features, and our UI allows you to preview the transform prior to saving the webhook. Transforms can be modified at any time.
