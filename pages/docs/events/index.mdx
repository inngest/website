# Events

Firstly, make sure you have the [`inngest`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inngest) package installed via NPM or yarn:

```bash
npm install inngest  # or yarn add inngest
```

Start with creating an `Inngest` client. An "Event Key" is required to send events ([How to create an Event Key](/docs/events/creating-an-event-key)):

```typescript
import { Inngest } from 'inngest';

// Recommended: Set an INNGEST_EVENT_KEY environment variable for automatic configuration:
const inngest = new Inngest({ name: "Your app name" });

// Or you can pass the eventKey explicitly to the constructor:
const inngest = new Inngest({ name: "Your app name", eventKey: "xyz..." });
```

Then, sending an event is simple, just call the the `send()` method with your event payload ([Read about the payload format](/docs/events/event-format-and-structure)):

```typescript
// This sends an event to Inngest.
await inngest.send({
  // The event name
  name: "storefront/cart.checkout.completed",
  // The event's data
  data: {
    account: {
      id: 123,
      email: "test@example.com",
    },
    cartId: "ed12c8bde",
    itemIds: ["9f08sdh84", "sdf098487", "0fnun498n"],
  }
});
```

<Callout>

ðŸ‘‰ You should always use `await` or `.then()` with `send()` to ensure that the event has been sent to Inngest. Serverless platforms may terminate early and prevent an event from being successfully sent.

</Callout>

Sending this event, named `storefront/cart.checkout.completed`, to Inngest will do two things:

1. Automatically run any [functions](/docs/functions) that are triggered by this specific event, passing the event payload to the function's arguments.
2. Store the event payload in Inngest cloud, creating a new event type and event version if it doesn't already exist.

<Callout>

ðŸ’¡ One event can trigger multiple functions, enabling you to consume a single event in multiple ways. This is different than traditional message queues where only one worker can consume a single message.

</Callout>

## Sending multiple events at once

You can also send multiple events in a single `send` call. This enables you to send a batch of events very easily. You can send up to `512kb` in a single call which means you can send anywhere between 10 and 1000 typically sized payloads at once.

```typescript
await inngest.send([
  { name: "storefront/cart.checkout.completed", data: { ... } },
  { name: "storefront/coupon.used", data: { ... } },
  { name: "storefront/loyalty.program.joined", data: { ... } },
])
```

This is especially useful if you have an array of data in your app and you want to send an event for each item in the array:

```typescript
// Let's say
const importedItems = await api.fetchAllItems();
const events = importedItems.map((item) => ({
  name: "storefront/item.imported",
  data: {
    ...item,
  }
}));
await inngest.send(events);
```

## Advanced usage

There's more you can do with events, such as [user identification](/docs/events/event-format-and-structure#optional-fields), event versioning, and filtering for each key.
