“Event Keys” are unique keys that allow you to send or publish events to Inngest. You can use an event key with the Inngest SDK.

```jsx
const client = new Inngest("<Inngest Event Key>")
client.send(...)
```

Event keys are meant to be specific to a given environment (production, test) and a specific source (your API, your mobile app, etc.). You can easily create and manage your event keys from the Inngest Cloud dashboard.

## Creating a new source

From the Inngest Cloud dashboard, you need to create a new “**Source**.”

1. Click on “Sources” ([direct link](https://app.inngest.com/sources))
2. Click on “Add Source” ([direct link](https://app.inngest.com/sources/new))
3. Select “API” then “Create a new source key” ([direct link](https://app.inngest.com/sources/new#API)
4. Copy the newly created key using the “Copy” button:

🎉 You can now use this event key with the Inngest SDK to send events directly from any codebase. You can also:

- Rename your source using the “Name” field so you and your team can identify it later
- Delete the source when your key is no longer needed
- Filter events by name or IP addresses for increased control and security

## Best practices

1. We recommend creating a unique key per source and per environment (production/test - Tip: use the environment toggle)
2. For client-side sources where the event key may be visible in the browser, we recommend filtering events by name (e.g. `website/page.viewed` or pattern `website/*`) to discourage spam events from being sent to your Inngest Cloud account.
