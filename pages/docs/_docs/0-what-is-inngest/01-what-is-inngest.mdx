Inngest is an **event-driven queue**.  Instead of configuring queues directly with all the associated work, Inngest decouples your queue from your systems by using events. 

## Concepts

Fundamentally, there are two critical concepts to Inngest:

- [**Events**](/docs/event-format-and-structure), which represent something happening in your system (or a 3rd party)
- [**Functions**](/docs/functions/introduction), which are triggered by events or on a schedule.  They declaratively state how they're triggered, and are fully versioned.

Whenever something happens, like a user signs up, you'll send an event to Inngest.  You can then build functions which are automatically triggered by these events, without writing a single line of code relating to a queue â€” no workers, no config, no infra.

## Benefits

Decoupling your async work via events has a few benefits.  At a high level, **it's faster and easier** to work with, and has less ops overhead.  You can:

- Deploy your functions independently, without updating core services
- Add canary or blue-green deploys to any function, out of the box
- Immediately roll back to a previous function version
- Re-run past events through functions, even if the function is new
- Historically test functions with previously received events

It's also easier to get started and learn. Events are sent via a plain HTTP call, and engineers don't need to concern themselves with queue-specific implementation details.  You only need to know how your function is triggered and the data within that event;  from there, you're only writing your business logic.

There's more that Inngest provides, such as user identification within events for customer-specific audit trails and debugging, or event schemas out of the box.

For now, [let's dive into the architecture](/docs/high-level-architecture) and then see [how to get started within a few minutes](/docs/quick-start).
