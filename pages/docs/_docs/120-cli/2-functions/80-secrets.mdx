Secrets are passed as environment variables to your functions in production. For example, if you were writing a Node.js function that used a `DATABASE_URL` secret to connect to a PlanetScale database, you would reference it just like any other environment variable:

```js
const mysql = require("mysql2/promise");

async function main({ event }) {
  const connection = await mysql.createConnection(process.env.DATABASE_URL);

  const [result] = await connection.execute(
    "INSERT INTO signups (email, signup_reason) VALUES (?)",
    [event.user.email, event.data.signup_reason]
  );
  return result;
}
```
