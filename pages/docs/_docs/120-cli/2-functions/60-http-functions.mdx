As an alternative to deploying your function code directly to the Inngest platform, you can also use Inngest to trigger any one of your application's exisitng HTTP endpoints. This is a great way to quickly get started with some of your existing code.

## How it works

Inngest will sent an HTTP `POST` request to the URL of your choosing with your event payload.

![A diagram showing a HTTP request to a signup endpoint and a background job being dispatched via Inngest](/assets/blog/run-nextjs-functions-in-the-background/call-url-diagram.gif)

Let's take a look at an example [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) API endpoints that grabs the `event` payload JSON from the `POST` request body and sends an email:

```js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  // `event` is the event payload
  const { event } = req.body;
  // Here's an example of using the event payload to send an email
  const result = await sendEmail({
    template: "welcome-email",
    to: event.user.email,
    data: {
      // The template will use this to show useful content to our new user
      signupReason: event.user.data.signupReason,
    },
  });
  const messasge = result.ok ? "Successfully sent" : result.error;
  res.status(result.ok ? 200 : 500).json({ message });
}
```

Any HTTP response that is a `2xx` status code will be considered a success. All others will be considered a failure. The response payload will be visible as the function's result in the Inngest dashboard. We'll capture the status code, the response body and any error that we capture:

```
{
  status: int
  body: string
  error?: string
}
```

## Request headers

All requests sent from Inngest will be `POST` requests with the following headers:

- `Content-Type: application/json`
- `User-Agent: Inngest/1.0 (+https://www.inngest.com/docs/http-functions)`

_Soon we'll be adding header(s) for authentication - want to test them early? [ping us in Discord](https://discord.com/invite/EuesV2ZSnX)_
