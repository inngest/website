It's inevitable that steps in a function fail.  In many cases - but not always - it's useful to automatically retry the step that errors.  Inngest has this capability built in and, unlike other systems, errors can be customized based off of logic within the steps itself.

## Failure detection

Steps are classified as failed if either of the following conditions are met:

- A step exits with a non-zero status code, as per unix defaults
- A step returns a non-2xx status code within their [response](/docs/functions/function-input-and-output)

## Retry policies

By default, each step is retried 3 times using [exponential backoff](https://github.com/inngest/inngest/blob/main/pkg/backoff/backoff.go) with jitter. Retries can be customized using the `status` or `statusCode` response:

* `2xx` - Successful: this is not a failure, no retry is necessary
* `4xx` - Bad request: **this step will not be retried**, as this error is irrecovarble
* `5xx` - Server error: something temporarily failed.  **This will be retried according to the retry policy (3 times, by default)**.

We're currently working on implementing custom retry policies per steps, documented [in this issue](https://github.com/inngest/inngest/issues/117).
