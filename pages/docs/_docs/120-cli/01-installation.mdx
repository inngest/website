Inngest is available as a self-contained binary, via NPM, or can be built form source.

## Prerequisites

Inngest relies on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Buildx](https://docs.docker.com/build/buildx/) to create cross-platform containers, so Docker itself must be installed.

<details>
<summary>Installing Docker</summary>

Check if you have Docker installed by running `docker version`.

If you don't, we'd recommend installing [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/). It's available for [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), [Mac on Apple silicon](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/apple-silicon/), [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/), or [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/), and will automatically install the Docker Buildx plugin.

<details>
<summary>Installing Docker Buildx</summary>

Check if you have Docker Buildx installed by running `docker buildx version`.

Installing and using [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) in the above step will automatically install the Docker Buildx plugin. Alternatively, you can install Docker Buildx manually using the [Install Docker Buildx](https://docs.docker.com/build/buildx/install/) docs. Summarized, for Mac and Linux you can:

1. Navigate to the [latest `docker/buildx` release](https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/latest)
2. Copy the link of the binary appropriate for your architecture
3. Run the command below, optionally replacing the URL to the binary if it's different

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins \
  && curl -o ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-buildx -L https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/download/v0.9.1/buildx-v0.9.1.linux-amd64 \
  && chmod +x ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-buildx
```

<h2 className="pt-4">Installing via NPM</h2>

Run the following to install the Inngest CLI globally:

```
npm install -g inngest-cli
```

<h2 className="pt-8">Downloading the binary</h2>

Run the following to download the latest version of the Inngest CLI to your current working directory:

```
curl -sfL https://cli.inngest.com/install.sh | sh
```

This will place inngest in your $PWD.  Move it into your $PATH to invoke: `sudo mv ./inngest /usr/local/bin/inngest`.

You can also download [prebuilt binaries](https://github.com/inngest/inngest/releases) from Github or [build from source](https://github.com/inngest/inngest), with Go 1.18+ installed.
