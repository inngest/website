Follow along to learn how to:

- Write a background function triggered by an event
- Write a scheduled function

Writing functions is the same no matter what platform you deploy to ‚Äî so this example can be used for any TypeScript or JavaScript project (such as NextJS, Netlify, or Lambda).

## Install the SDK

Firstly, you need to install the SDK via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install inngest  # or yarn add inngest
```

## Writing a background function

Copy the following code into a new file in your project, for example within `./inngest/function.ts`

```typescript
import { createFunction } from "inngest";

// This function runs the code and will be called in the background.
const job = async ({ event }) => {
  return "hello!"; // You can write whatever you want here.
}

export const demoFunction = createFunction<DemoEvent>(
  "Demo function",   // The name of your function, used for observability.
  "demo/demo.event", // The event that triggers this function.
  job,               // The function code, defined above.
)
```

This defines a new background job which runs any code that you pass it.  This function is automatically triggered in the background whenever the demo/test.event event is received.  You can test this function using standard tooling such as Jest or Mocha by exporting the job code and running standard unit tests.

üíÅ **Why event-driven?**

Using events to trigger functions has many benefits:

1. It‚Äôs simple:  there‚Äôs no config to define, and no queues to configure
2. You can run many functions with a single event (fan-out)
3. Each event has its own type, so that your data is always correct
4. Inngest stores each event you receive, making testing and debugging simple

## Writing a scheduled function

The following code defines a scheduled function, which runs automatically using the specified cron schedule:

```typescript
import { createScheduledFunction } from "inngest";

// This code will be called by the scheduled function.
const job = async () => {
  return "hello!"; // You can write whatever you want here.
}

export createScheduledFunction(
  "Demo function", // The name of your function, used for observability.
  "0 * * * *",     // The cron syntax for the function
  job,             // The function code, defined above.
)
```

This is very similar to defining an event-driven function, except it uses the `createScheduledFunction` call and a cron schedule to run your function at the specified interval.  This code can be deployed to any platform and will run automatically, without any HTTP calls.
