The `inngest init` command is used to initialize new functions locally from the [Inngest scaffolds repository](https://github.com/inngest/scaffolds).

## Usage

```
$ inngest init
```

This will ask you a few short questions including:

1. The name of your new function
2. What event that you want to trigger your function
3. Which programming language that you want to use

Completing this will provide you with a new directory matching the name of your function with the following:

- `inngest.json` - The configuration file for your function
- `./events` - The directory containing all event schemas in `.cue` files
- Any other files that are part of the [language scaffold](https://github.com/inngest/scaffolds)

If you chose "another language" you will have to create a `Dockerfile` and your function files manually.
