The Inngest CLI allows you to build and test event-driven serverless functions locally on your own machine. Using this CLI, you can:

- **Scaffold** new serverless functions in seconds
- **Run** functions with test data for fast development
- **Test** functions with live, historical data
- **Deploy** functions instantly

The Inngest CLI source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-cli).

## How to install

```
curl -sfL https://cli.inngest.com/install.sh | sh && \
  sudo mv ./inngest /usr/local/bin/inngest
```

Alternatively, you can:

1. [Download the latest pre-built binary from our releases page here](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-cli/releases/latest).
2. [Build the CLI from source, as long as you have Go installed](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-cli).

## Requirements

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is a required dependency for the CLI in order to build, run, and deploy your functions. You can find more information on installing Docker on your system here: [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
