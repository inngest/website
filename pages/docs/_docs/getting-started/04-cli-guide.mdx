This guide explains how to initialize, develop, test, and then deploy your functions, with best practices and guidance, using the Inngest CLI.

The general flow of writing a serverless function using our CLI ‚Äî which we‚Äôll walk through in detail ‚Äî is:

1. Initialize a new function using `inngest init`
2. Add your logic to the function, depending on what the function needs to do
3. Test the function by running it locally, using `inngest run`
4. Deploy the function to your host, using `inngest deploy`

We‚Äôll run through each of these steps beginning with **installing the CLI.** More advanced steps include setting up CI/CD; testing with historical, real-world data; monitoring your functions; and deploying to > 1 cloud provider.

## Installing the CLI

To begin the process you‚Äôre going to need to install the CLI. The quickest and easiest method is by copying and pasting the following into your terminal:

```go
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inngest/inngest-cli/main/install.sh | sh && \
  sudo mv ./inngest /usr/local/bin/inngest
```

Alternatively, you can:

1. [Download the latest pre-built binary from our releases page here](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-cli/releases/latest).
2. [Build the CLI from source, as long as you have Go installed](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-cli).

Once installed, running `inngest` from the CLI will print the following:

```
hi@inngest.com $ inngest

    ____                            __
   /  _/___  ____  ____ ____  _____/ /_
   / // __ \/ __ \/ __ '/ _ \/ ___/ __/
 _/ // / / / / / / /_/ /  __(__  ) /_
/___/_/ /_/_/ /_/\__, /\___/____/\__/
                /____/

Usage:
  inngest [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  deploy      Deploy a function to Inngest
  help        Help about any command
  init        Create a new serverless function
  login       Logs in to your Inngest account
  run         Run a serverless function locally

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for inngest

Use "inngest [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

With the CLI installed, you can create your first function.

## Creating your first function

Our CLI allows you to create a new serverless function using a single command. You can start developing in seconds by running `inngest init`.

When you run `inngest init`, you‚Äôll be asked for the following questions:

1. **Your function name,** for easily understanding your functions.
2. **A function trigger,** which specifies the event that automatically triggers your function.
3. **A function language,** using one of our pre-built templates.

We‚Äôll guide you through the `inngest init` process this guide‚Äôs function, and afterwards we‚Äôll walk through what these options mean in detail.

### Making your first function

Let‚Äôs go ahead and run `inngest init` to create your function:

```

Let's get you set up with a new serverless function.
Answer these questions to get started.

1. Function name:
‚Üí
```

For this guide, we‚Äôll name the function ‚ÄúPost-payment flow‚Äù.

After you‚Äôve entered your function name you‚Äôll be prompted to select the **event that triggers the function**. In this case, type `stripe/` and select the `stripe/charge.succeeded` event. This function will be triggered any time this event is received in your Inngest account.

Finally, let‚Äôs select the ‚ÄúTypescript‚Äù language to use the typescript template. You should see the following:

```go
hi@inngest.com $ inngest init

Let's get you set up with a new serverless function.
Answer these questions to get started.

1. Function name: Post-payment flow
2. Event: stripe/charge.succeeded
3. Language: typescript

üéâ Done!  Your project has been created in ./post-payment-flow

  ## Next steps

  1. `cd` into your project at `./post-payment-flow`
  2. Run `npm install`  to install the base dependences
  3. Add your logic within src/index.ts

For more information, read our documentation at https://www.inngest.com/docs
```

Your serverless function is ready to go in a new folder: `./post-payment-flow`.

### Triggers

Serverless functions need to be invoked to run. In Inngest, functions are invoked by a _trigger_, which can be one of two things:

- **An event**, such as a JSON payload from your API, a webhook payload such as Stripe‚Äôs `charge.succeeded` event, someone signing in to your app, your own queuing system, an HTTP request, etc.
- **A cron schedule**, allowing you to run functions repeatedly on a schedule

Specifying the trigger before you begin developing your function allows you to make sure you‚Äôre working with the right data, and it makes sure that your function doesn‚Äôt have bugs relating to data issues.

<aside>
  <p>
    <b>Tip:</b>{" "}
    <strong>
      Inngest asks you for the event that triggers the function before you get
      started.
    </strong>{" "}
    This allows the CLI to automatically generate types for your function, to
    run local mock testing, and to ensure that invalid data doesn‚Äôt cause issues
    for your function in production.
  </p>
</aside>

<aside>
  <p>
    Tip: Our event browser shows you{" "}
    <strong>
      all events you‚Äôve received in your Inngest account after logging in via{" "}
      <code>inngest login</code>
    </strong>
    , along with events available via integrations. We automatically record and type
    any event you receive in your account.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also <strong>define your own custom events from the CLI</strong> by
    typing in the name of a new event.
  </p>
</aside>

### Languages

As well as specifying the trigger, you need to choose the language that you‚Äôll use to write your serverless function.

The language you choose will be used to create the function‚Äôs bootstrapping logic, and we‚Äôll create a Dockerfile for you to bundle and compile your function into a working image.

<aside>

<p>
  <b>Note:</b> If the language you‚Äôd like to work with isn‚Äôt yet supported, let
  us know by making an issue in the CLI repository and we‚Äôll get started on it.
</p>

</aside>

## Writing and testing code

Once your project has been initialized, you can navigate to the directory containing your code to start writing your business logic. Each Inngest function has an `inngest.json` or `inngest.cue` file at the project‚Äôs root directory, which defines the function configuration:

```tsx
{
  // name represents the function's name
  "name": "Post-payment flow",
  // id is the function ID within Inngest
  "id": "sensible-ant-ac49c5",
  // triggers are a list of triggers that invoke the function
  "triggers": [
    {
      "event": "stripe/charge.succeeded",
      "definition": {
        "format": "cue",
        // synced ensures that inngest is the source of truth.
        "synced": true,
        "def": "file://./events/stripe-charge-succeeded.cue"
      }
    }
  ]
```

In the Typescript template, your code begins execution within `./src/index.ts`. An empty project contains the following:

```tsx
import type { Args } from "./types";

export async function run({ event }: Args) {
  // Your logic goes here.
  return event.name;
}
```

Your serverless function is passed the `event` as an argument, allowing your code to work with the incoming event‚Äôs data. You can install any packages you need to handle your business logic. For example, given you receive a new payment you can:

- Use node-fetch or axios to call other external APIs
- Send notifications via slack, discord, or email
- Create new purchase orders, shipments, or order fulfillment requests
- Store data in your own datastores eg. for recordkeeping, or ML
- Send the event to your own data warehouse

### Locally testing your function

For now, we‚Äôll run the entire project as-is. Running the command `inngest run` in the project root will build your serverless function, then run it locally using mock data.

Let‚Äôs build and test the base project:

<video controls>
  <source src="/assets/video/guide-run.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

From here, you can make changes to `./src/index.ts`, then re-run `inngest run` to compile and test your serverless function.

<aside>
  <p><b>Tip:</b> You can re-run functions with the same data by passing a <code>--seed</code> argument into <code>inngest run</code>.  You can also pipe events into <code>inngest run</code> via stdin to invoke your function with custom data: <code>echo '&#123;&#125;' | inngest run</code>.</p>

</aside>

<aside>
  <p>
    <b>Tip:</b> You can also re-run functions using historical production or
    test data from your Inngest account via the CLI. This allows you to
    guarantee that your function works given real-world data.
  </p>
</aside>

## Deploying your function

When your function is ready to deploy, you can build and launch your function with a single command: `inngest deploy`. The CLI will re-build your image (using `buildx`), push a new version of the function to Inngest, and make this function version live.

You must be logged in to your Inngest account to fully deploy your function. First, run `inngest login` to log in, and type your email address and password to log in.

<aside>
  <p>
    <b>Tip:</b> Every function you deploy with Inngest is fully versioned. You
    can see all versions for a function, including when each version was live.
    If necessary, you can roll back to previous versions with a single click in
    our UI.
  </p>
</aside>

With our upcoming Lambda compatibility, the CLI will deploy the function to your own Lambda account. Inngest itself will trigger your lambda function every time the event is received, or on the schedule you specify.

That‚Äôs it! With three commands ‚Äî `inngest init`, `inngest run`, and `inngest deploy` ‚Äî you‚Äôve built, locally tested, and deployed a serverless function, without writing any config or boilerplate code.
