- How to deploy to your platform of choice
- How to register your functions with Inngest after your deploy


## Deploying to your platform

Firstly, you need to deploy functions as an API to your platform.  Depending on your platform of choice,
you'll want to deploy Inngest's serve functionality as a single serverless function available via HTTP.

## Registering live functions with Inngest

Now that your function API is live, we need to let Inngest know which functions you‚Äôve deployed; which events or schedules cause them to run; and the URL in which they‚Äôre hosted.


There are several ways you can register your functions with Inngest:

### Registering automatically

Automatically deploy your Inngest functions on each deployment of your site. If your platform isn't listed, you can still register using the methods below!

### Registering via the UI

You can add your endpoint‚Äôs URL to Inngest via the dashboard:

<video controls autoPlay loop muted>
  <source
    src="/assets/docs/sdk-deploy.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>



### Registering via the API

You can register your function‚Äôs endpoints with a single PUT call to your function endpoint:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://www.example.com/api/inngest
```

This can be built in to your CI/CD process so that *after your site has deployed* you make this call to register your functions.  The guides for each platform talk about how to do this in more detail.

If, for some reason, you can‚Äôt create a PUT call to your endpoint you can register functions via Inngest‚Äôs own API by sending the URL in a PUT request:

```bash
curl -X PUT --data '{"url":"https://www.example.com/api/inngest"}' https://api.inngest.com/fn/register
```

üíÅ You'll need to register your functions with Inngest after each deploy.  This can be automated for each platform you deploy to.
