All Inngest functions are defined as `inngest.json` or `inngest.cue` files. The file is generated by the [`inngest init`](/docs/cli/init) command, but you can create a file manually or edit it as needed. You can use [Cue](https://cuelang.org/), which is a superset of JSON for additional language features.

## The fields

Here's an example `inngest.json` file with annotations for what each component is:

```json twoslash
{
// @log: The name of your function or step function, this will be visible in the UI
  "name": "Send SMS Dispatch",
// @log: The uniquely generated ID for the function. This is used by the CLI for CRUD operations.
  "id": "prompt-deer-ede40d",
// @log: Triggers is an array of event or scheduled triggers for the function (see below)
  "triggers": [
    {
      "event": "worker.dispatched",
      "definition": {
        "format": "cue",
        "synced": false,
        "def": "file://./events/worker-dispatched.cue"
      }
    }
  ],
// @log: These are the steps of the function. A function can have 1 to n steps. Each step can declare another step that triggers it. Declaring no explit step trigger for a step will execute it once the Function's top level trigger is executed. (See below for more info on Steps)
  "steps": {
    "step-1": {
      "id": "step-1",
      "path": "file://./steps/send-sms-dispatch",
      "name": "Send SMS Dispatch",
      "runtime": {
        "type": "docker"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Function triggers

A function can have 1 or more triggers which are defined in the following format. As a given event is received or schedule is executed, the function is executed starting with the first step. There are two types of triggers: Events and Schedules.

### Event triggers

```json twoslash
{
// @log: The event name or pattern for which to match, you can use a wildcard as well like "worker.*" if you'd like to match against multiple events.
  "event": "worker.dispatched",
// @log: The event definition can reference a local Cue file which declares the schema of the event itself. This is used with the `inngest run` command to generate test event data
  "definition": {
    "format": "cue",
    "synced": false,
    "def": "file://./events/worker-dispatched.cue"
  }
}
```

### Scheduled triggers

```json twoslash
{
// @log: Scheduled triggers are configured as cron expressions with 1 single parameter
  "cron": "0 12 * * *"
}
```

## Steps

The list of steps is an object, with each step using a unique key `id` and it's own step configuration. A function can have 1 to n steps. For more information about steps, check out the [Step Functions](/docs/functions/step-functions) documentation.

```json twoslash
"steps": {
// @log: The step id - this must be unique
  "step-1": {
    "id": "step-1",
// @log: The path to the step's code including a Dockerfile for Docker runtime functions.
    "path": "file://./steps/send-sms-dispatch",
// @log: A nicely formatted name for the step for logging and UI purposes
    "name": "Send SMS Dispatch",
// @log: A runtime declaration instructing Inngest how to execute your function
    "runtime": {
      "type": "docker"
    }
  },
  "step-2": {
    "id": "step-2",
    "path": "file://./steps/log-confirmation-for-admin",
    "name": "Log confirmation for admin",
// @log: The "after" parameter is used to specify which step to execute this step after. This allows you to chain steps together to create complex DAGs
    "after": {
// @log: Step is a string which is the ID of the previous step
      "step": "step-1",
// @log: Wait is an optional field that specifies a delay between executing steps, e.g. "24h" or "1h30m"
    },
    "runtime": {
      "type": "docker"
    }
  }
```
