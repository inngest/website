Firstly, make sure you have the [`inngest`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inngest) package installed via NPM or yarn:

```bash
npm install inngest  # or yarn add inngest
```

Start with creating an `Inngest` client. An "Event Key" is required to send events ([How to create an Event Key](/docs/creating-an-event-key)):

```typescript
import { Inngest } from 'inngest';

// Recommended: Set an INNGEST_EVENT_KEY environment variable for automatic configuration:
const inngest = new Inngest({ name: "Your app name" });

// Or you can pass the eventKey explicitly to the constructor:
const inngest = new Inngest({ name: "Your app name", eventKey: "xyz..." });
```

Then, sending an event is simple, just call the the `send()` method with your event payload ([Read about the payload format](/docs/event-format-and-structure)):

```typescript
// This sends an event to Inngest.
inngest.send({
  // The event name
  name: "demo/demo.event",
  // The event's data
  data: {
    account: {
      id: 123,
      email: "test@example.com",
    },
    cartID: "ed12c8bde",
    like: true,
  }
});
```

Sending this event, named `demo/demo.event`, to Inngest will do two things:

1. Automatically run any [functions](/docs/functions) that are triggered by this specific event, passing the event payload to the function's argumnts.
2. Create a new event version, if it doesn't already exist, in Inngest Cloud and infer the event payload's structure, [generating a Type for use with TypeScript](/docs/typescript)

⚡️ When you send an event, Inngest will automatically run any functions that are triggered by the same event name — in parallel, in the background, without configuring any queues.

### Advanced usage

There's more you can do with events, such as [user identification](/docs/event-format-and-structure#optional-fields), event versioning, and filtering for each key.
