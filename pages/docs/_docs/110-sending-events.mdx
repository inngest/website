Follow along to learn how to:

- Send events to Inngest so that you can automatically trigger any subscribing functions.

## Sending events

Firstly, make sure you have the `inngest` package installed via NPM or yarn.  Then, from your code, write the following:

```typescript
import { Inngest } from 'inngest';

// Create a new client using your inngest event key
export const client = new Inngest({ name: "Your app name" });

// This sends an event to Inngest.
client.send({
  // The event name
  name: "demo/demo.event",
  // The event's data
  data: {
    account: {
      id: 123,
      email: "test@example.com",
    },
    cartID: "ed12c8bde",
    like: true,
  }
});
```

This code does two things.  We first create a new `client` using an event key.  Event keys are only used for sending events, and cannot access any other part of your account.

Then, using the client, we send the event named `demo/demo.event` to Inngest. Inngest will accept this event and do the following:

1. See if the event already exists within your account.  If not, we’ll automatically create a new version of this event and infer the type from the data sent.
2. Look up any functions triggered by this event, then run them automatically in parallel using the entire event object supplied as the function’s arguments.

💁 When you send an event, Inngest will automatically run any functions that are triggered by the same event name — in parallel, in the background, without configuring any queues.

### Advanced usage

There’s more you can do with events, such as user identification, event versioning, and filtering for each key.
