Inngest enables you to host your functions on Vercel using their [serverless functions platform](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions). This allows you to deploy your Inngest functions right alongside your existing website and API functions running on Vercel.

Inngest will call your functions securely via HTTP request on-demand, whether triggered by an event or on a schedule in the case of cron jobs.

## Hosting Inngest functions on Vercel

After you've written your functions using [Next.js](/docs/frameworks/nextjs?ref=docs-deploy-vercel) or Vercel's [Express-like](/docs/frameworks/express?ref=docs-deploy-vercel) functions within your project, you need to serve them via the `serve` handler. Using the `serve` handler, create a Vercel/Next.js function at the `/api/inngest` endpoint. Here's an example in a Next.js app:

```js
// ./pages/api/inngest.js
import { serve } from "inngest/next";
import firstFunction from "../../inngest/first";
import anotherFunction from "../../inngest/another";

export default serve("Your app's name", [ firstFunction, anotherFunction ]);
```

## Deploying to Vercel

Installing [Inngest's official Vercel integraiton](https://vercel.com/integrations/inngest) does 2 things:

1. Automatically sets the required `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` environment variable to securely communicate with Inngest's API
2. Automatically deploys new functions to Inngest every time you deploy updated code to Vercel - no need to change your existing workflow!

After you're installed, every new deploy to Vercel will update functions in [the Inngest dashboard](https://app.inngest.com/functions) within a few seconds!

### Manually registering functions

While we strongly recommend our Vercel integration, you can still use Inngest by manually telling Inngest that you've deployed updated functions.

#### Registering via the UI

You can add your endpoint's URL to Inngest via the dashboard:

<video controls autoPlay loop muted>
  <source
    src="/assets/docs/sdk-deploy.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

#### Registering via the API

You can register your function's endpoints with a single PUT call to your function endpoint:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://www.example.com/api/inngest
```

We suggest adding this to your CI/CD process so that *after your site has deployed* you make this call to register your functions. The guides for each platform talk about how to do this in more detail.
