You can test functions locally, across any framework, by using our CLI.  The CLI
provides everything you need to receive events and run functions on your machine.

Follow along to learn how to:

- View the SDK dashboard
- Run the CLI
- Test functions using the SDK and CLI together


## View the SDK dashboard

The SDK provides a built-in UI via the  [`serve` handler for your framework
(read the docs here)](https://short-testing-section.website-s5l.pages.dev/docs/functions#serving),
which shows you all of your registered functions and allows you to send test events
to trigger your functions. Follow these steps to see the SDK UI:

1. Ensure you're serving the Inngest SDK for your framework
2. Run your project, eg. via `yarn dev` for NextJS
3. Browse to your site's URL at `/api/inngest`, eg. `http://localhost:3000/api/inngest`.

You will see the following UI:

## Run the CLI

The CLI runs Inngest locally, allowing you to process events and run functions on
your own machine.

To run the CLI, copy the command from the header of your SDK UI. The command looks
similar to the following, using your own URL/port:

```bash
npx inngest-cli@latest dev -u http://localhost:3000/api/inngest
```

The CLI will automatically connect to your project, initialize your functions,
and start an HTTP server which accepts events from your project.  When events
are received, the CLI will run your functions automatically, and show output
in the CLI's logs.

Once you've started the dev server, you should see your functions registered
and ready to go in the output! In addition, our SDK debug page will now show
that we're connected to the dev server.

## Testing functions

With the CLI running, your SDK UI page should show that you're connected to
the dev server.

You can use the SDK UI to send test events to the CLI. Enter your event into
the input box and hit send to send the event to Inngest.  Any functions
that subscribe to your event will run in the background!

Here's an example:

  ```sh
  12:18PM INF api > publishing event event={"data":{"name":"Inngest"},"id":"01GFX481B6482Y32VSQFB6BJJY","name":"demo/event.sent"} event_name=demo/event.sent id=01GFX481B6482Y32VSQFB6BJJY
  12:18PM INF runner > received message event=demo/event.sent id=01GFX481B6482Y32VSQFB6BJJY
  12:18PM INF runner > initializing fn event=demo/event.sent function=my-next-js-app-hello-world id=01GFX481B6482Y32VSQFB6BJJY
  12:18PM INF executor > executing action dsn=inngest.com/my-next-js-app-hello-world-step-step-test run_id=01GFX481H2KSDE7JNHR1Y0XT1J scopes=null step=step version=null

  ```
</details>

From here, learn how to send events to Inngest using the SDK.  In development, with
the dev server running, events will automatically be sent to your local CLI and will
trigger functions locally.
