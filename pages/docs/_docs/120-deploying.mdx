- How to deploy to your platform of choice
- How to register your functions with Inngest after your deploy


## Deploying to your platform

Firstly, you need to deploy functions as an API to your platform.

üíÅ Inngest deploys a single serverless API endpoint that hosts all registered functions

## Registering live functions with Inngest

Now that your function API is live, we need to let Inngest know which functions you‚Äôve deployed; which events or schedules cause them to run; and the URL in which they‚Äôre hosted.

üíÅ You'll need to register your functions with Inngest after each deploy.  This can be automated for each platform you deploy to.

There are several ways you can register your functions with Inngest:

### Registering via the UI

You can add your endpoint‚Äôs URL to Inngest via the dashboard:

<!-- TODO: VIDEO -->

### Registering via the API

You can register your function‚Äôs endpoints with a single PUT call to your function endpoint:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://www.example.com/api/inngest
```

This can be built in to your CI/CD process so that *after your site has deployed* you make this call to register your functions.  The guides for each platform talk about how to do this in more detail.

If, for some reason, you can‚Äôt create a PUT call to your endpoint you can register functions via Inngest‚Äôs own API by sending the URL in a PUT request:

```bash
curl -X PUT --data '{"url":"https://www.example.com/api/inngest"}' https://api.inngest.com/fn/register
```

This getting started guide has shown you how to write functions, send events to trigger them, deploy them, and register the functions with Inngest.
