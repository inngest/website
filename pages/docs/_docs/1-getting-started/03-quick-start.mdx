This guide will run through setting up your local development version of Inngest's event-driven queue.  By the end of this guide, you'll have a working devlepment server which runs functions in response to custom events.  It'll only take a couple of minutes.

We'll run through:

- Installing the CLI
- Running the server locally, via `inngest dev`
- Creating functions, via `inngest init`
- Detail on the development lifecycle.

**Prerequisites**

- In order to build and run functions, docker must be installed.  It's easy to get started.
- We use buildx to build your images locally, so use a recent version of Docker.


## Install the CLI

You can install the CLI by running the following script:

```
curl -sfL https://cli.inngest.com/install.sh | sh
```

This will place inngest in your $PWD.  Move it into your $PATH to invoke: `sudo mv ./inngest /usr/local/bin/inngest`.

You can also download [prebuilt binaries](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-cli/releases) from Github or [build from source](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-cli), with Go 1.18+ installed.

## Run the server locally

With the CLI installed, you only need to run `inngest dev` to start the entire local environment.  This environment only persists state in-memory, so is not production ready.

When you run the dev server, the command will recursively read your current directory to find all functions (defined by `inngest.json` files.  If one or more functions are found, the dev server will accept events on `http://127.0.0.1:9999`.  If not, the dev server will stop.

To get started we're going to need to create a function which can be triggered by events.


## Creating a new function

Functions can be created by running `inngest init`.

**Additional tips:**

- If you're on arm and you're not using Docker for Mac, you should [install the binfmt emulators](https://github.com/tonistiigi/binfmt#installing-emulators) to enable cross-compilation.  This is only required for deploys.
