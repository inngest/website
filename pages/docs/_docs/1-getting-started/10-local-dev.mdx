You can install Inngest on your local machine and run a full copy of the Inngest API and executor, emulating a production environment.

## Install the CLI

First, you must install the [Inngest CLI](https://www.github.com/inngest/inngest):

```
curl -sfL https://cli.inngest.com/install.sh | sh \
  && sudo mv ./inngest /usr/local/bin/inngest
```

To verify that Inngest is installed, run `inngest`.  You should see the following output:

```
 $ inngest

    ____                            __
   /  _/___  ____  ____ ____  _____/ /_
   / // __ \/ __ \/ __ '/ _ \/ ___/ __/
 _/ // / / / / / / /_/ /  __(__  ) /_
/___/_/ /_/_/ /_/\__, /\___/____/\__/
                /____/

## Run Inngest locally

You can run the Inngest dev server locally with an in-memory state store and queue by running:

```
$ inngest dev
```

This boots up an API which listens for events on `http://127.0.0.1:9999`.  When the dev server receives
events, it will match the event against any functions within your working directory and invoke those
functions locally.
