It's possible to self host the components of Inngest, and manage the entire system within your own environment.

## Overview

There are multiple components to Inngest, each of which will need to be created:

**State & infrastructure**
- The **state store**, which records state for function runs.
- The **queueing system**, which schedules and invokes particular steps within a function
- The **messaging system**, which acts as an event bus for incoming events
- The **config store**, which manages source keys, function metadata, and action metadata

**APIs & Services**
- The **source API**, which accepts events and publishes them to the messaging system
- The **runner**, which receives events from the messaging system and enqueues functions
- The **executor**, which executes individual steps within a function.

## Requirements

The state store, queueing systems, and messaging systems must be highly available.  We have multiple
drivers for each, and recommend using widely available systems such as hosted, HA Redis, SQS/SNS, or
Google Pub/Sub.
