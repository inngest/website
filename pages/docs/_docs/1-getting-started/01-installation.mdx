Inngest is available as a self-contained binary, via NPM, or can be built form source.

Inngest itself relies on [buildx](https://docs.docker.com/build/buildx/) to create cross-platform containers, so Docker itself must be installed.

<h2 className="pt-4">Installing via NPM</h2>

Run the following to install the Inngest CLI globally:

```
npm install -g inngest-cli
```

<h2 className="pt-8">Downloading the binary</h2>

Run the following to download the latest version of the Inngest CLI to your current working directory: 

```
curl -sfL https://cli.inngest.com/install.sh | sh
```

This will place inngest in your $PWD.  Move it into your $PATH to invoke: `sudo mv ./inngest /usr/local/bin/inngest`.

You can also download [prebuilt binaries](https://github.com/inngest/inngest/releases) from Github or [build from source](https://github.com/inngest/inngest), with Go 1.18+ installed.
