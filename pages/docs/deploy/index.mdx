# Deploying

Inngest allows you to host your function code on any platform then invokes your functions via HTTP. To deploy functions to Inngest, all you need to do is tell Inngest _where_ to find them!

## How functions are "deployed"

Since your code is hosted on another platform, you need to **register** _where_ your functions are hosted with Inngest. For example, if you set up the `serve` handler ([see docs](/docs/sdk/serve)) at `/api/inngest`, and your domain is `https://myapp.com`, you'll need to inform Inngest that your functions are hosted at `https://myapp.com/api/inngest`.

You need to do this every time your functions are updated so Inngest can register the latest versions of your functions.

Inngest uses the `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` to securely communicate with your application and identify the correct environment to register your functions.

## How to deploy

### Deploying automatically with an integration

### Deploying manually via the Inngest dashboard

1. Deploy your application with it's `serve` handler endpoint to the platform of your choosing.
2. In the Inngest dashboard, select your environment (e.g. "Production").
3. Select the "Deploys" tab at the top then the "Deploy" button at the top right.
4. Within the modal add the full URL where your `serve` handler is set up and click "Deploy."

### Deploying manually via curl

If you're prefer to deploy from your machine or automate this within a CI/CD pipeline, you can send a simple `PUT` request to your own application's `serve` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://myapp.com/api/inngest
```

This request will trigger your application to register your functions with the Inngest API, securely, using your environment's `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY`.

**Tip** - You'll need to ensure that the latest version of your application is live on your platform before registering with Inngest. Some platforms have rolling deploys that take seconds or minutes until the latest version of your application is live.

This is especially important when setting up your own automated process.
