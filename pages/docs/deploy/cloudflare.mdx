# Cloudflare Pages


Inngest allows you to deploy your event-driven functions to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

## Deploying to Cloudflare Pages

1. [Write your functions](/docs/functions)
2. [Serve your functions](/docs/sdk/serve#framework-cloudflare)
3. [Set environment variables](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/#environment-variables) for your deployment
  - `NODE_VERSION: 16`
  - `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY: ***` - from [your dashboard secrets](https://app.inngest.com/secrets)

##  Registering your functions

Now that your function API is live, we need to let Inngest know which functions you’ve deployed; which events or schedules cause them to run; and the URL in which they’re hosted.


There are several ways you can register your functions with Inngest:

### Registering via the UI

You can add your endpoint’s URL to Inngest via the dashboard:

<video controls autoPlay loop muted>
  <source
    src="/assets/docs/sdk-deploy.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>



### Registering via the API

You can register your function’s endpoints with a single PUT call to your function endpoint:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://www.example.com/api/inngest
```

This can be built in to your CI/CD process so that *after your site has deployed* you make this call to register your functions.  The guides for each platform talk about how to do this in more detail.

If, for some reason, you can’t create a PUT call to your endpoint you can register functions via Inngest’s own API by sending the URL in a PUT request:

```bash
curl -X PUT --data '{"url":"https://www.example.com/api/inngest"}' https://api.inngest.com/fn/register
```
