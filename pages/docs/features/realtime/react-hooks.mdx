# React hooks

Realtime provides a `useInngestSubscription()` react hook, used to subscribe
using a token and collate streamed data for you.

```tsx
import { useInngestSubscription } from "@inngest/realtime/hooks";

export default function MyComponent({ token }: { token: string }) {
  // Use a user scoped token to subscribe to channels:
  const { data } = useInngestSubscription({
    token,
  });

  return (
    <div>
      {data.map((message, i) => (
        <div key={i}>{message.data}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Inputs

- `app: Inngest` - The Inngest client to use for subscribing. Does not require a signing
  key, as we subscribe using a token.
- `enabled?: boolean` - Whether or not the hook will subscribe or not.
- `bufferInterval?: number` - If set and above `0`, the outputs will only update
  every `n` milliseconds. This helps with very busy streams that could overwhelm
  a UI.
- `token?: Realtime.Subscribe.Token` - The token to be used for subscribing (see [Subscribe from the client](/docs/features/realtime#subscribe-from-the-client))
- `refreshToken?: () => Promise<Realtime.Subscribe.Token>` - A function that
  will be called if no `token` is available, or if the hook has been
  re-`enabled` and the previous `token` has expired.

### Outputs

- `data: Array<Realtime.Message>` - All messages received on the subscription in
  chronological order.
- `latestData: Realtime.Message` - A shortcut to the last message
  received on the subscription. Useful for streams where each message is the
  latest state of an entity.
- `freshData: Array<Realtime.Message>` - If `bufferInterval` is active, this
  will be the last batch of messages released from the buffer. If
  `bufferInterval` is inactive, this is always the latest message.
- `error: Error | null` - If truthy, this is an error with the subscription.
- `state: InngestSubscriptionState` - The current state of the subscription, one
  of `"closed"`, `"error"`, `"refresh_token"`, `"connecting"`, `"active"`, or `"closing"`.
