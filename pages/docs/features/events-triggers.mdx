# Events & Triggers

Inngest functions are triggered asynchronously by **events** coming from various sources, including:


<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Your application" icon={<CloudIcon />} href={'/docs/events'}>
    Send an event from your application’s backend with the Inngest SDK.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cron schedule" icon={<ClockIcon />} href={'/docs/guides/scheduled-functions'}>
    Run an Inngest function periodically with a trigger using cron syntax.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Webhook events" icon={<WebhookIcon />} href={'/docs/platform/webhooks'}>
    Use Inngest as a webhook consumer for any service to trigger functions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Another Inngest function" icon={<BranchIcon />} href={'/docs/guides/invoking-functions-directly'}>
    Directly invoke other functions to compose more powerful functions.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

You can customize each of these triggers in multiple ways:

- **[Filtering event triggers](/docs/guides/writing-expressions)** - Trigger a function for a subset of matching events sent.
- **[Delaying execution](/docs/guides/delayed-functions)** - Trigger a function to run at a specific timestamp in the future.
- **[Batching events](/docs/guides/batching)** - Process multiple events in a single function for more efficient systems.
- **[Multiple triggers](/docs/guides/multiple-triggers)** - Use a single function to handle multiple event types.


## Why events?

Using Events to trigger Inngest Functions instead of direct invocations offers a lot of flexibility:

- Events can trigger multiple Inngest Functions.
- Events can be used to synchronize Inngest Function runs with [cancellation](/docs/features/inngest-functions/cancellation) and [“wait for event” step](/docs/reference/functions/step-wait-for-event).
- Events can be leveraged to trigger Functions across multiple applications.
- Similar Events can be grouped together for faster processing.

Events act as a convenient mapping between your application actions (ex, `user.signup`) and your application's code (ex, `sendWelcomeEmail()` and `importContacts()`):
