# Inngest Functions

Inngest functions enable developers to run reliable background logic, from background jobs to complex workflows. They provide robust tools for retrying, scheduling, and coordinating complex sequences of operations.


## Anatomy of an Inngest Function

<Row>

  <Col>

       An Inngest Function is composed of 3 main parts:

       - A unique or list of Events, Cron schedules or webhooks that [can Trigger the Function](/docs/features/event-triggers)
       - [Steps](/docs/features/steps-workflows) to transform your Inngest Function in a workflows with durable checkpoints that can be parallelized
       - [Flow Control](/docs/guides/flow-control) configuration to control how runs get distributed in time with concurrency, throttling and more
