# Inngest Functions

Inngest functions enable developers to run reliable background logic, from background jobs to complex workflows.
An Inngest Function is composed of 3 main parts that provide robust tools for retrying, scheduling, and coordinating complex sequences of operations:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Triggers" icon={<EventIcon />} href={'/docs/features/events-triggers'}>
    A list of Events, CRON schedules or webhooks that trigger Function runs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Flow Control" icon={<IconPriority size={24} />} href={'/docs/guides/flow-control'}>
    Control how Function runs get distributed in time with Concurrency, Throttling and more.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Steps" icon={<StepsIcon />} href={'/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows'}>
    Transform your Inngest Function into a workflow with retriable and parallelizable checkpoints.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>


Increase your Inngest Functions durability by leveraging:

- **[Retries features](/docs/features/inngest-functions/errors-retries)** - Configure a custom retry policy, handle rollbacks and idempotency.
- **[Cancelation features](/docs/features/inngest-functions/cancelation)** - Automatically or manually prevent any unnecessary or unwanted runs.
- **[Versioning best practices](/docs/learn/versioning)** - Strategies to gracefully introducing changes in your Inngest Functions.


## Using Inngest Functions

Start using Inngest Functions by using the pattern that fits your use case:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Background jobs" icon={<StepsIcon />} href={'/docs/guides/multi-step-functions'}>
    Run long-running tasks  out of the critical path of a request.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Delayed Functions" icon={<RunsIcon />} href={'/docs/learn/how-functions-are-executed'}>
    Schedule Functions that run in the future.
  </Card>
  <Card title="CRON Functions" icon={<RunsIcon />} href={'/docs/guides/scheduled-functions'}>
    Build Inngest Functions as CRONs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Workflows" icon={<RunsIcon />} href={'/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows'}>
    Start creating worflows by leveraging Inngest Function Steps.

## Learn more about Functions and Steps

Functions and Steps are powered by Inngest's Durable Execution Engine. Learn about its inner working by reading the following guides:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="How Functions are executed" icon={<RunsIcon />} href={'/docs/learn/how-functions-are-executed'}>
    A deep dive into Inngest's Durable Execution Engine with a step-by-step workflow run example.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Thinking in Steps" icon={<StepsIcon />} href={'/docs/guides/multi-step-functions'}>
    Discover by example how steps enable more reliable and flexible functions with step-level error handling, conditional steps and waits.
