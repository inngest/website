# Failure handlers

If your function exhausts all of its retries, it will be marked as "Failed." You can handle this circumstance by either providing an [`onFailure/on_failure`](/docs/reference/functions/handling-failures) handler when defining your function, or by listening for the [`inngest/function.failed`](/docs/reference/system-events/inngest-function-failed) system event.

The first approach is function-specific, while the second covers all function failures in a given Inngest environment.

<Callout>
  In any way you will need to re-sync your app for the onFailure-code to register and work!

# Examples

The example below checks if a user's subscription is valid a total of six times. If you can't check the subscription after all retries, you'll unsubscribe the user:

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: "TypeScript" }}
/* Option 1: give the inngest function an `onFailure` handler. */
inngest.createFunction(
  {
    id: "update-subscription",
    retries: 5,
    onFailure: async ({ event, error }) => {
      // if the subscription check fails after all retries, unsubscribe the user
      await unsubscribeUser(event.data.userId);
    },
  },
  { event: "user/subscription.check" },
  async ({ event }) => { /* ... */ },
);
/* Option 2: Listens for the [`inngest/function.failed`](/docs/reference/functions/handling-failures#the-inngest-function-failed-event) system event to catch all failures in the inngest environment*/
inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "handle-any-fn-failure" },
  { event: "inngest/function.failed" },
  async ({ event }) => { /* ... */ },
);
```

```python {{ title: "Python" }}
# Option 1: give the inngest function an [`on_failure`] handler.
async def update_subscription_failed(ctx: inngest.Context, step: inngest.Step):
    # if the subscription check fails after all retries, unsubscribe the user
    await unsubscribe_user(ctx.data.userId)

@inngest_client.create_function(
    fn_id="update-subscription", 
    retries=5,
    on_failure=update_subscription_failed,
    trigger=TriggerEvent(event="user/subscription.check"))
async def update_subscription(ctx: Context, step: Step):
    pass # ...


# Option 2: Listens for the [inngest/function.failed](/docs/reference/functions/handling-failures#the-inngest-function-failed-event)
# system event to catch all failures in the inngest environment
@inngest_client.create_function(
    fn_id="global_failure_handler",
    trigger=[
        TriggerEvent(event="inngest/function.failed"),
        #TriggerEvent(event="inngest/function.cancelled")
    ],
)
async def global_failure_handler(ctx: Context, step: Step):
    pass # handle all failures, e.g. to send to sentry
```
