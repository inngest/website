# Failure handlers

If your function exhausts all of its retries, it will be marked as "Failed." You can handle this circumstance by providing an [`onFailure`](/docs/reference/functions/handling-failures) handler when defining your function.

<Callout variant="warning">
  _Failure handlers_ are only supported in the TypeScript SDK.
</Callout>

The example below checks if a user's subscription is valid a total of six times. If you can't check the subscription after all retries, you'll unsubscribe the user:

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: "TypeScript" }}
inngest.createFunction(
  {
    id: "update-subscription",
    retries: 5,
    onFailure: async ({ event, error }) => {
      // if the subscription check fails after all retries, unsubscribe the user
      await unsubscribeUser(event.data.userId);
    },
  },
  { event: "user/subscription.check" },
  async ({ event }) => { /* ... */ },
);
```
</CodeGroup>

Internally, this handler creates a second function that listens for the [`inngest/function.failed`](/docs/reference/functions/handling-failures#the-inngest-function-failed-event) event, which you can listen to yourself to capture all failed runs across your system.

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: "TypeScript" }}
inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "handle-any-fn-failure" },
  { event: "inngest/function.failed" },
  async ({ event }) => { /* ... */ },
);
```
</CodeGroup>

<Callout>
  To handle cancelled function runs, checkout out [this example](/docs/examples/cleanup-after-function-cancellation) that uses the [`inngest/function.cancelled`](/docs/reference/system-events/inngest-function-cancelled) system event.
</Callout>
