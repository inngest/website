# Steps & Workflows

Steps are the building blocks of Inngest Functions:

- They enable isolated retries in case of failures with a point-in-time recovery (*only failed steps reruns*)
- They add waits capabilities, such as pausing a workflow for hours up to months
- They can be run in loops and parallel with **`Promise.all()`**, enabling faster processing
- They support waiting for events, enabling cross Functions synchronization
- Finally, when running on Serverless environments, they unlock longer execution time, removing timeouts

All those capabilities make Inngest Functions a perfect fit for building workflows.
