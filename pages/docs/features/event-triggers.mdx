# Events & Triggers

      Inngest uses Events to trigger Function runs.

      This enables Inngest Functions to be triggered from various sources: your application, another Inngest Function, CRON schedule, or webhooks.

      An Inngest Function can be triggered based on one or multiple events or on some specific Event attributes by leveraging [Event expressions](https://www.notion.so/docs/guides/writing-expressions).

      Beyond triggering Functions, Events can also be used to sync multiple runs together by using [Event Waiting](https://www.notion.so/docs/reference/functions/step-wait-for-event).
