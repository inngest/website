# Invoking functions directly

Inngest's `step.invoke()` function provides a powerful tool for calling functions directly within your event-driven system. It differs from traditional event-driven triggers, offering a more direct, RPC-like approach. This encourages a few key benefits:

- Allows functions to call and receive the result of other functions
- Naturally separates your system into reusable functions that can spread across process boundaries
- Allows use of synchronous interaction between functions in an otherwise-asynchronous event-driven architecture, making it much easier to manage functions that require immediate outcomes

## Invoking another function

```ts
// Some function we'll call
const computeSquare = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "compute-square" },
  { event: "calculate/square" },
  async ({ event }) => {
    return { result: event.data.number * event.data.number }; // Result typed as { result: number }
  }
);

// In this function, we'll call `computeSquare`
const mainFunction = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "main-function" },
  { event: "main/event" },
  async ({ step }) => {
    const square = await step.invoke("compute-square-value", {
      function: computeSquare,
      data: { number: 4 }, // input data is typed, requiring input if it's needed
    });

    return `Square of 4 is ${square.result}.`; // square.result is typed as number
  }
);
```

In the above example, our `mainFunction` calls `computeSquare` to retrieve the resulting value. `computeSquare` can now be called from here or any other process connected to Inngest.

## Creating a distributed system

The use of `step.invoke()` means that we can separate functions out into compositions of steps that can be reused by _any_ process connected to Inngest.

By starting to define these blocks of functionality, you're creating a smart, distributed system with all of the benefits of event-driven architecture and without any of the hassle.

## Similar patterns: Fan-Out

A similar pattern to invoking functions directly is that of fan-out - [check out the guide here](/docs/guides/fan-out-jobs). Here are some key differences:

- Fan-out will trigger multiple functions simultaneously, whereas invocation will only trigger one
- Unlike invocation, fan-out will not receive the result of the invoked function
- Choose fan-out for parallel processing of independent tasks and invocation for coordinated, interdependent functions
