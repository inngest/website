# Rate limiting

Rate limiting is a _hard limit_ on how many function runs can start within a time period. Events that exceed the rate limit are _skipped_ and do not trigger functions to start. This prevents excessive function runs over a given time period. Some use cases for rate limiting include:

* Preventing abuse of your system
* Reducing frequency of data synchronization functions
* Smoothing out noisy [webhook](/docs/platform/webhooks) events

## How to configure rate limiting

<CodeGroup forceTabs>
```ts
export default inngest.createFunction(
  {
    id: "synchronize-data",
    rateLimit: {
      limit: 1,
      period: "4h",
      key: "event.data.company_id",
    },
  },
  { event: "intercom/company.updated" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    // This function will be rate limited
    // It will only run 1 once per 4 hours for a given event payload with matching company_id
  }
);
```
</CodeGroup>

Rate limiting is configured through the `rateLimit` option on each function.

### Configuration reference

* `limit` - The maximum number of functions to run in the given time period.
* `period` - The time period of which to set the limit. The period begins when the first matching event is received.
* `key` - An optional [expression](/docs/guides/writing-expressions) using event data to apply each limit too. Each unique value of the `key` will have it's own limit, enabling you to rate limit function runs by any particular key, like a user id.

<Callout>
  Any events received in excess of your `limit` are ignored. This means this is not the right approach if you need to process every single event sent to Inngest. Instead, check out [throttle](/docs/guides/throttling).
</Callout>

## How rate limiting works

Each time an event is received that match's your function's trigger, it is evaluated prior to executing your function. If `rateLimit` is configured, Inngest uses the `limit` and `period` options to only execute a maximum number of functions during that period.

Inngest's rate limiting implementation uses the [“Generic Cell Rate Algorithm”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_cell_rate_algorithm) (GCRA). To _overly simplify_ how this works, Inngest will use the `limit` and `period` options to create "buckets" of time in which your function can execute _once_.

```
limit / period = bucket time window
```

For example, this means that for a `limit: 10` and `period: '60m'` (60 minutes), the bucket time window will be 6 minutes. Any event triggering the function "fills up" the bucket for that time window and any additional events are ignored until the bucket's time window is reset. The algorithm (GCRA) is more sophisticated than this, but at the basic level - `rateLimit` ensures that you'll only run the max `limit` number of items over the `period` that you specify.

<Callout>
  Events that are ignored by the function will continue to be stored by Inngest.
</Callout>

### Using a `key`

When a `key` is added, a separate limit is applied for each unique value of the `key` expression. For example if your `key` is set to `event.data.customer_id`, each customer would have their individual rate limit applied to functions run meaning different users might have the same function run in same bucket time window, but two runs will not happen for the same `event.data.customer_id`. Read [our guide to writing expressions](/docs/guides/writing-expressions) for more info.

**Note** - To prevent duplicate events from triggering your function more than once in a 24 hour period, use [the `idempotency` option](/docs/guides/handling-idempotency#at-the-function-level-the-consumer) which is the equivalent to setting `rateLimit` with a `key`, a `limit` of `1`  and `period` of `24hr`.
