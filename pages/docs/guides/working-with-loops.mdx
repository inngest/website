# Working with Loops in Inngest

In Inngest each step in your function is executed as a separate HTTP request.  This means that for every step in your function, the function is re-entered, starting from the beginning, up to the point where the next step is executed. This [execution model](/docs/learn/how-functions-are-executed) helps in managing retries, timeouts, and ensures robustness in distributed systems.

This page covers how to implement loops in your Inngest functions and avoid common pitfalls.

## Simple function example

Let's start with a simple example to illustrate the concept:

```javascript
inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "simple-function" },
  { event: "test/simple.function" },
  async ({ step }) => {
    console.log("hello");

    await step.run("a", async () => { console.log("a") });
    await step.run("b", async () => { console.log("b") });
    await step.run("c", async () => { console.log("c") });
  }
);
```

In the above example, you will see "hello" printed four times, once for the initial function entry and once for each step execution (`a`, `b`, and `c`).

```bash {{ title: "✅ How Inngest executes the code" }}

# This is how Inngest executes the code above:

<run start>
"hello"

"hello"
"a"

"hello"
"b"

"hello"
"c"
<run complete>
```
```bash {{ title: "❌ Common incorrect misconception" }}

# This is a common assumption of how Inngest executes the code above.
# It is not correct.

<run start>

"hello"
"a"
"b"
"c"

<run complete>
```
</CodeGroup>

Any non-deterministic logic (like database calls or API calls) must be placed inside a `step.run` call to ensure it is executed correctly within each step.

With this in mind, here is how the previous example can be fixed:

```ts
inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "simple-function" },
  { event: "test/simple.function" },
  async ({ step }) => {
    await step.run("hello", () => { console.log("hello") });

    await step.run("a", async () => { console.log("a") });
    await step.run("b", async () => { console.log("b") });
    await step.run("c", async () => { console.log("c") });
  }
);

// hello
// a
// b
// c
```

Now, "hello" is printed only once, as expected.

## Implementing Loops in Inngest

To ensure your loops run correctly within [Inngest's execution model](/docs/learn/how-functions-are-executed):

### 1. Treat each loop iterations as a single step

In a typical programming environment, loops maintain their state across iterations. In Inngest, each step re-executes the function from the beginning to ensure that only the failed steps will be re-tried. To handle this, treat each loop iteration as a separate step. This way, the loop progresses correctly, and each iteration builds on the previous one.

### 2. Place non-deterministic logic inside steps

Place non-deterministic logic (like API calls, database queries, or random number generation) inside `step.run` calls. This ensures that such operations are executed correctly and consistently within each step, preventing repeated execution with each function re-entry.

### 3. Use sleep effectively

When using `step.sleep` inside a loop, ensure it is combined with structuring the loop to handle each iteration as a separate step. This prevents the function from appearing to restart and allows for controlled timing between iterations.

Consider this function:

```typescript
inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "loop-sleep" },
  { event: "test/loop.sleep" },
  async ({ step }) => {
    for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
      console.log("Loop iteration", i);
      await step.sleep("sleep", "1s");
      await step.run("log", () => {
        console.log("Slept for 1 second");
      });
    }
  },
);
```

In the example, every step method is run in a separate HTTP request, which means Inngest needs to start the function from the beginning each time. The SDK receives a request, runs the next unmemoized step, and then exits early to report the results. So as Inngest runs each step, it gets further into the loop iterations.


With this in mind, the above code will be executed in Inngest as follows:

<CodeGroup forceTabs>
```bash {{ title: "✅ How Inngest executes the code" }}

# This is how Inngest executes the code above:

<run start>

Loop iteration 0

Loop iteration 0
<sleep>
Slept for 1 second

Loop iteration 0
Loop iteration 1

Loop iteration 0
Loop iteration 1
<sleep>
Slept for 1 second

Loop iteration 0
Loop iteration 1
Loop iteration 2

Loop iteration 0
Loop iteration 1
Loop iteration 2
<sleep>
Slept for 1 second

<run complete>
```
```bash {{ title: "❌ Common incorrect misconception" }}

# This is a common assumption of how Inngest executes the code above.
# It is not correct.

<run start>

Loop iteration 0
<sleep>
Slept for 1 second

Loop iteration 1
<sleep>
Slept for 1 second

Loop iteration 2
<sleep>
Slept for 1 second

<run complete>
```
</CodeGroup>

When writing an Inngest function, assume all code outside of `step.run` is executed multiple times. All code within `step.run` is executed once (if it ran successfully and does not need a retry).
