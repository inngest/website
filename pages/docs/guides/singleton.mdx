# Singleton Functions <VersionBadge version="TypeScript v3.38.0+" /> <VersionBadge version="Python v0.5+" />

<Info>
  These docs are part of a developer preview for Inngest's Singleton Functions API. Learn more about the [developer preview here](#developer-preview).
</Info>



Singleton Functions enable you to ensure that only a single run of your function (_or a set of specific function runs, based on specific event properties_) is happening at a time.

## When to use Singleton Functions

Singleton Functions are useful when you want to ensure that only a single instance of a function is running at a time, for example:
- A third-party data synchronization workflow
- A compute- or time-intensive function that should not be run multiple times at the same time (ex: AI processing)


### Singleton compared to concurrency:

While [Concurrency](/docs/guides/concurrency) set to `1` ensures that only a single step of a given function is running at a time, Singleton Functions ensure that only a single run of a given function is happening at a time.


### Singleton compared to Rate Limiting:

[Rate Limiting](/docs/guides/rate-limiting) is similar to Singleton Functions, but it is designed to limit the number of runs started within a time period, whereas Singleton Functions are designed to ensure that only a single run of a function occurs over a given time window.

Rate Limiting is useful for controlling the rate of execution of a function, while Singleton Functions are useful for ensuring that only a single run of a function occurs over a given time window.






## How it works

Singleton Functions are configured using the `singleton` property in the function definition.

The following `data-sync` function will skip new runs if another run of the same function is already running for the same user:

```ts
const dataSync = inngest.createFunction({
    id: "data-sync",
    singleton: {
      key: "event.data.user_id",
      mode: "skip",
    }  
  },
  { event: "data-sync.start" },
  async ({ event }) => {
    // ...
  },
);
```

Refer to the [reference documentation](/docs/reference/functions/singleton) for more details.

### Using a `key`

When a `key` is added, the unique runs rule is applied for each unique value of the `key` expression. For example, if your `key` is set to `event.data.user_id`,
each user would have their individual singleton rule applied to functions runs, ensuring that only a single run of the function is happening at a time for each user. Read [our guide to writing expressions](/docs/guides/writing-expressions) for more information.


{/* ### Two modes: Skip vs Cancel

Singleton Functions can be configured to either skip the new run or cancel the existing run and start a new one.

The `mode` property configures the behavior of the Singleton Function.

- `"skip"` skips the new run.
- `"cancel"` cancels the existing run and starts the new one. */}


## Compatibility with other flow control features

Singleton Functions can be combined with other flow control features, with the following considerations:

| Flow control | Compatibility | Considerations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Debounce](/docs/guides/debounce) | ✅ | Can be used together without issues. |
| [Rate limiting](/docs/guides/rate-limiting) | ✅ | Similar functionality but rate limiting operates over a predefined time window rather than function execution duration. | 
| [Throttling](/docs/guides/throttling) | ✅ | Similar functionality but throttling enqueues events over time rather than discarding/canceling them. |
| [Concurrency](/docs/guides/concurrency) | ❌ | Singleton functions implicitly have a concurrency of 1. A concurrency setting can be set but should be used with caution. |
| [Batching](/docs/guides/batching) | ❌ | Not compatible with singleton functions. |


## Developer preview

Singleton Functions is a developer preview feature and are subject to change without following semver.

Developer preview help us getting early feedback from the community. You can share your feedback in the [Inngest Discord](https://discord.gg/inngest) or via our [support channel](https://app.inngest.com/support).

The following limitations are known and will be addressed in a future release:

- Skipped runs are not visible in the Inngest dashboard.
- Singleton isn't compatible with batching; function registration will fail if both are set.

Read the [release phases](/docs/release-phases) for more details.


## FAQ

### How does Singleton Functions work with retries?

If a singleton function fails and is retrying, it should still skip new incoming runs.
