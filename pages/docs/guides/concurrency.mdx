# Concurrency management

Managing concurrency is important for any production system. Inngest provides concurrency controls that allow you to create **multi-level virtual queues** **within each function**, directly in code, without thinking about infrastructure. Use cases include:
- **Setting global limits for many functions which share a pool of resources**, for example with many functions which use shared AI capacity, or global DB connections.
- **Setting limits on your own individual accounts, tenants or users**, for example limiting unpaid users to a specific capacity.
- **A combination of the above**, with functions limited by the lowest/most constrained concurrency key.

## How to configure concurrency

Inngest lets you provide fine-grained concurrency across all functions in a simple, configurable manner.  You can control each function's concurrency limits within your function definition. Here are two examples:

```js
// Example 1:  A complete, complex example with two virtual concurrency queues.
inngest.createFunction(
  {
    id: "unique-function-id",
    concurrency: [
      {
         // Use an account-level concurrency limit for this function, using the
         // "openai" key as a virtual queue.  Any other function which
         // runs using the same "openai"` key counts towards this limit.
         scope: "account",
         key: `"openai"`,
         // If there are 10 functions running with the "openai" key, this function's
         // runs will wait for capacity before executing.
         limit: 10,
      },
      {
         // Create another virtual concurrency queue for this function only.  This
         // limits all accounts to a single execution for this function, based off
         // of the `event.data.account_id` field.
         // "fn" is the default scope, so we could omit this field.
         scope: "fn",
         key: "event.data.account_id",
         limit: 1,
      },
    ],
  }
  { event: "ai/summary.requested" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
  }
);

// Example 2: a simple concurrency definition limiting this function to 10 steps at once.
inngest.createFunction(
  {
    id: "another-function",
    concurrency: 10,
  }
  { event: "ai/summary.requested" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
  }
);
```

In the first example, we define **two concurrency constraints that create two virtual queues to manage capacity**. Runs will be limited if they hit either of the virtual queue's limits. For example:
- If there are 10 steps executing under the 'openai' key's virtual queue, any future runs will be blocked and will wait for existing runs to finish before executing.
- If there are 5 steps executing under the 'openai' key and a single `event.data.account_id` enqueues 2 runs, the second run is limited by the `event.data.account_id` virtual queue and will wait before executing.

In the second example, the function is constrained to `10` executing steps at once.



## Concurrency reference

<Properties>
  <Property name="limit" type="number" required>
    The maximum number of concurrently running steps.
    A value of `0` or `undefined` is the equivalent of not setting a limit.
    The maximum value is dicated by your accout's plan.
  </Property>
  <Property name="scope" type="'account' | 'env' | 'fn'">
    The scope for the concurrency limit, which impacts whether concurrency is managed on an individual function, across an environment, or across your entire account.

    * `fn` (default):  the concurrency limit applies to runs within this function only
    * `env`:  the concurrency limit applies to all functions within the same environment that share the same evaluated key value.  This requires setting a "key" which evaluates to a virtual queue name.
    * `account`:  the concurrency limit applies to all functions in your account that share the same evaluated key value.  This requires setting a "key" which evaluates to a virtual queue name.

    Each SDK exposes these enums in the language's idiomatic manner, though the meanings of the enums are the same across all languages.
  </Property>
  <Property name="key" type="string">
    A unique key expression for which to restrict concurrently running steps to. The expression is evaluated for each triggering event.  A key is required when setting an `env` or `account` level scope. 

    Expressions are defined using the Common Expression Language (CEL) with the original event accessible using dot-notation. Read [our guide to writing expressions](/docs/guides/writing-expressions) for more info. Examples:

    * Limit concurrency to `n` (via `limit`) per customer id: `'event.data.customer_id'`
    * Limit concurrency to `n` per user, per import id: `'event.data.user_id + "-" + event.data.import_id'`
    * Limit globally using a specific string: `'"global-quoted-key"'` (wrapped in quotes, as the expression is evaluated as a language)
  </Property>
</Properties>

## Concurrency control across specific steps in a function

You might need to set a different concurrency limit for a single step in a function. For example, within an AI flow you may have 10 pre-processing steps which can run with higher limits, and a single AI call with much lower limits.

To control concurrency on indivudal steps, extract the step into a new function with its _own_ concurrency controls, and invoke the new function using `step.invoke`. This lets you combine concurrency controls and manage "flow control" in a clean, composible manner.

## How concurrency works

**Concurrency works by limiting the number of steps executing at a single time.** Within Inngest, execution is defined as "an SDK running code". **Calling **`step.sleep`**, **`step.sleepUntil`**, or **`step.waitForEvent`** does not count towards capacity limits**, as the SDK doesn't execute code while those steps wait. Because sleeping or waiting is common, concurrency _does not_ limit the number of functions in progress; it specifically limits the number of steps executing at any single time.

**Concurrency is strictly ordered from oldest to newest ([FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO))** across the same function.  Ordering amongst different functions is not guaranteed.  This means that within a specific function, Inngest prioritizes finishing older functions above starting newer functions - even if the older functions continue to schedule new steps to run.  Different functions, however, compete for capacity, with runs on the most backlogged function much more likely (but not guaranteed) to be scheduled first.

Inngest manages concurrency for you within our scheduling system, and you do not need to provision queues, infrastructure, or manage concurrency limits within your own workers or services.

## Global conflicts in two function definitions

You may write two functions that define different levels for an 'account' scoped concurrency limit.  For example, function A may limit the "ai" capacity to 5, while function B limits the "ai" capacity to 50:

```js
inngest.createFunction(
  {
    id: "func-a",
    concurrency: [
      {
         scope: "account",
         key: `"openai"`,
         limit: 5,
      },
    ],
  }
  { event: "ai/summary.requested" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
  }
);

inngest.createFunction(
  {
    id: "func-b",
    concurrency: [
      {
         scope: "account",
         key: `"openai"`,
         limit: 50,
      },
    ],
  }
  { event: "ai/summary.requested" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
  }
);
```


This works in Inngest and is *not* a conflict.  Instead, function A is limited any time there are 5 or more functions running in the 'openai' queue.  Function B, however, is limited when there are 50 or more items in the queue.  This means that function B has more capacity than function A, though both are limited and compete on the same virtual queue.

Because functions are FIFO, function runs are more likely to be worked on the older their jobs get (as the backlog grows).  If function A's jobs stay in the backlog longer than function B's jobs, it's likely that their jobs will be worked on as soon as capacity is free.  That said, function B will almost always have capacity before function A and may block function A's work.

**While this works we strongly recommend that you use global constants for `env` or `account` level scopes, giving functions the same limit.**

## Limitations

- Concurrency limits the number of steps executing at a single time. It does not _yet_ perform rate limiting over a given period of time. This is scheduled for a Q2 '24 release.
- Functions can specify up to 2 concurrency constraints at once
- The maximum concurrency limit is defined by your account's plan
- Ordering amongst the same function is guaranteed (with the exception of retries)
- Ordering amongst different functions is not guaranteed.  Functions compete with each other randomly to be scheduled.
