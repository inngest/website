# Building a Workflow Engine for your users

Users today are demanding customization and integrations from every product. Your users may want your product to support custom workflows to automate key user actions. Custom, user-defined workflows can be a powerful feature to add to your product, but it is not without challenges. To build a workflow engine you need to:

- Define a series of pre-built tasks that user can select from
- Create a way for users to use these tasks to build our their workflow
- **Build a system that can execute tasks from a given workflow whenever it is triggered**

Building a system like this is difficult. To do this, you would traditionally need:

- Queues and/or event streams to trigger workflows
- Orchestration logic to determine _what_ task to execute and _when_ to execute it
- Queues to handle processing of of the tasks
- A state store that handles passing context and interim state between tasks
- Automatic retries of tasks that throw errors

Inngest can handle all of this for you enabling you to build a workflow engine in record time. Let's dig in to how you can do this:

## What is a "Workflow?"

Workflow is an overloaded term, but in the scope of this guide, we define a workflow as:

> A set of tasks that need to be executed in a specific order that may depend on the result from earlier tasks.

## A simple example

First, we'll show a simple example, then walk through how to build something like this yourself. This example shows a custom workflow that might get triggered when a CRM product's user changes the status of one of their leads.

```ts
import { inngest } from "./client";
import { sendEmail, sendSlackNotification } from "../lib/emails"; // your custom code

export const workflowExecutor = inngest.createFunction(
  { name: "CRM Workflow Executor" },
  { event: "crm/lead_status.changed" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    const { accountId } = event.data;

    // Load the workflow that the user defined
    const workflow = await step.run("Load workflow from database", async () => {
      return database.workflows.find({ accountId, trigger: "lead_status_changed" });
    });
    // The workflow here is represented as a simple series of actions
    /*
      "workflow": {
        "name": "Approval",
        "actions": [
          { "type": "filter", "data": { "field": "status", "value": "proposal_created" } }
          { "type": "email", "data": { "template": "proposal", "to": "leadEmail" } },
          { "type": "slack", "data": { "channel": "C12345" } },
          { "type": "wait", "data": { "duration": "2 days" } },
          { "type": "email", "data": { "template": "proposal_follow_up", "to": "salespersonEmail" } },
        ]
      }
    */

    // We allow filter to terminate the workflow early
    let shouldContinue = true;

    // We loop over all actions as long as there are any remaining and no filter has exited
    while (shouldContinue && workflow.actions.length) {
      const action = workflow.actions.unshift();

      // We now run one of our pre-build actions:
      switch (action.type) {

        // The filter action sets shouldContinue and can end the workflow at any time
        case "filter":
          shouldContinue = await step.run("Filter", async () => {
            // Filter uses the action's configuration to match against the values
            // in the triggering event:
            return event.data[action.data.field] === action.data.value;
          });
          break;

        // The email action just calls some external code that you imported
        case "email":
          await step.run("Send email", async () => {
            // Determine who the email should be sent to
            const sendToAddress = event.data[action.data.to];
            return await sendEmail({ to: sendToAddress, template: action.data.template });
          });
          break;

        // The slack action sends a pre-defined Slack notification to the user's channel
        case "slack":
          await step.run("Slack notification", async () => {
            // Grab the slack token from the database and post a message to the user's Slack
            const slackToken = await database.slack_tokens.find({ accountId })
            return await sendSlackNotification({
              channelId: action.data.channel,
              notificationType: event.data.status, // i.e. "proposal_created"
              slackToken,
            });
          });
          break;

        // The sleep action allows the workflow to pause for any amount of time
        case "sleep":
          await step.sleep(action.data.duration);
          break;
      }
    }

    // All actions have been executed, or the filter has determined to terminate the workflow early
    // We're all done and we can return some data for our logs:
    return {
      status: "completed",
      workflowName: workflow.name,
      accountId,
    };
  }
)
```
