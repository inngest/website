# Batching events

Batching allows a function to processing multiple events in a single run. This is useful for high load systems where it's more efficient to handle a batch of events together rather than handling each event individually. Some use cases for batching include:

* Reducing the number of requests to an external API that supports batch operations.
* Creating a batch of database writes to reduce the number of transactions.
* Reducing the number of requests to your [Inngest app](/docs/apps) to improve performance or serverless costs.

## How to configure batching

{/* NOTE - This should be moved to an example and we can make this more succinct */}
<CodeGroup forceTabs>
```ts {{ title: "record-api-calls.ts"}}
inngest.createFunction(
  {
    id: "record-api-calls",
    batchEvents: {
      maxSize: 100,
      timeout: "5s",
    },
  },
  { event: "log/api.call" },
  async ({ events, step }) => {
    // NOTE: Use the `events` argument, which is an array of event payloads
    const attrs = events.map((evt) => {
      return {
        user_id: evt.data.user_id,
        endpoint: evt.data.endpoint,
        timestamp: toDateTime(evt.ts),
      };
    });

    const result = await step.run("record-data-to-db", async () => {
      return db.bulkWrite(attrs);
    });

    return { success: true, recorded: result.length };
  }
);
```
</CodeGroup>

### Configuration reference

* `maxSize` - The maximum number of events to add to a single batch.
* `timeout` - The duration of time to wait to add events to a batch. If the batch is not full after this time, the function will be invoked with whatever events are in the current batch, regardless of size.

<Callout>
  It is recommended to consider the overall batch size that you will need to process including the typical event payload size. Processing large batches can lead to memory or performance issues in your application.
</Callout>

## How batching works

When batching is enabled, Inngest creates a new batch when the first event is received. The batch is filled with events until the `maxSize` is reached _or_ the `timeout` is up. The function is then invoked with the full list of events in the batch.

Depending on your SDK, the `events` argument will contain the full list of events within a batch. This allows you to operate on all of them within a single function.

## Combining with other flow control methods

Batching does not work with all other flow control features.

You _can_ combine batching with simple [concurrency](/docs/guides/concurrency) limits, but will not work correctly with the `key` configuration option.

You _cannot_ use batching with [idempotency](/docs/guides/handling-idempotency), [rate limiting](/docs/guides/rate-limiting), or [cancellation events](/docs/guides/cancel-running-functions#cancel-with-events).

## Limitations

* The maximum batch size is `100`. For the free tier, the maximum batch size is `25`.
