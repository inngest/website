# Error handling

intro

- things
- you
- can
- do

## Retries

functions have retries even without steps

you can configure them

survive temporary network issues or problems wth external APIs

## Failure handlers

can use `onFailure`

this just listens to `inngest/function.finished`
eda bro ;)

## Steps

steps have their own retries too

even if it _still_ fails, you can handle it in code natively

```tsandgo

```

this enables fun shit, like reliable rollbacks, or gracefully recovering from errors to run other steps, or maybe restart a set of steps
