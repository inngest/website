Product Design at Inngest is a fun and challenging role. Inngest is solving long standing developer problems in a novel way which means we're creating first-of-it's-kind user interfaces and experiences. You'll get to design experiences developers have only dreamed of.

Our overall developer experience spans from writing code with our SDK; to running our Dev Server for best-in-class local development; to using our cloud dashboard to monitor, observe and debug production systems. Your work will directly help design a cohesive user experience, wherever the user is along that journey.

- The [Dev Server UI](https://www.inngest.com/docs/local-development) is the companion to our SDK during local development. Developers use it for hours a day to get a fast feedback loop to rapidly iterate on their work. It needs to strike a balance of being informative and also streamlined.
- Our cloud dashboard is where developers operate their production systems. They need to quickly find and debug production issues and fix them. It's monitoring dashboards & observability tools can save developers hours of investigation.

You'll collaborate with the founders and our incredible team of engineers to craft a world-class experience every developer in the world can use. From ideation to research to UX to UI to development you'll have an impact across the product development process.

While experience with dev tools or B2B products is useful, it's not required.  We only require that you can ask great questions and dig into customer needs.

This role is remote, but requires at least a 4 hour working time overlap with US EDT. Ideally you live somewhere between the GMT + US Pacific time (PST) timezones

**What you'll do**

- Design product features form 0 to 1
- Iterating on existing product features based feedback and product analytics
- Create satisfying small UX interactions as well as design broad UX flows that support a best-in-class developer experience (DX)
- Work with customers to research requirements and validate solutions
- Write feature specs, user stories, briefs, UX wireframes, and collect requirements for new features.
- Work closely with engineers to deliver on features and designs.
- Collaborate with engineers to help build our design system over time with contributions with Tailwind & Storybook.
- Design improvements for our [marketing](https://www.inngest.com/) + [documentation website](https://www.inngest.com/docs)

**What your first 90 days will look like**

- First week: You'll learn how we work as a team and our approach to growth. You'll learn about our existing design resources and approach and learn about how our users use the product.
- By day 30: You'll be proficient with our weekly cadence of work and you'll have build a solid understanding of our product, users, and strategy. You'll have designed or redesigned a feature in one of our UIs. You'll have joined customer research or sales calls to help build product context on user needs.
- By day 90: You'll have designed significant changes to our UX + UI that have been implemented. You'll have contributed in some form to our design system/storybook components. You'll also have contributed ideas around product and new features. We're all aligned and mutually excited about how we work together now and in the future!

**What we build with**

- Design in Figma
- Frontend's are built with Tailwind, React, Next.js, TypeScript
- We're starting to adopt Storybook to build out the basics of a design system
- Collaborate via Linear, Notion, Github & Discord















--------
You will be our first Front-end engineer on the Inngest team. You'll be focused on building the best possible developer experience for our users by collaborating with designers, engineers and founders. Your work will mostly be focused across our development server and our cloud dashboard which enables a developer to go from building to operating their Inngest functions. We're building tools that developers will use in their everyday workflow so efforts to improve UX and performance are primary. Importantly, you'll need a strong product mindset and an interest in developer tools.

The location for this role is between Western Europe (CET) and US Pacific time (PT).

### What you'll do

- Build UIs for our cloud dashboard and our development server
- Collaborate with designers to create user experiences that save time and effort for our users
- Create and maintain React components and hooks to manage complex UI state and handle real-time updates.
- Work with backend engineers to design APIs that can be used across the Inngest cloud dashboard, dev server and CLIs.
- Contribute to growth efforts from writing [blog posts](https://www.inngest.com/blog), building [tools as marketing](https://typedwebhook.tools/), and contributing to [our developer documentation](https://www.inngest.com/docs).
- Dogfood the Inngest product and develop ideas for improvements, features, or integrations.
- Communicate with Inngest users through Github issues or questions on our Discord community.

### What you've done in your career

- You've been working in the front-end for a few years and you've seen popular tech come and go.
- You've used TypeScript for 1 or more years.
- You've extensively used React.js and have experience with React Hooks and Next.js.
- You've done some full-stack development and understand the backend.
- You've consumed and/or created GraphQL APIs.

### What your first 90 days will look like

- First week: You'll learn how we work as a team and our approach to growth. You'll also start to learn our system architecture and hopefully make a couple small contributions to the dev server UI, our cloud dashboard, or our website.
- By day 30: You'll be proficient with our weekly cadence of work and you'll have contributed a new feature to our dev server or cloud dashboard. You'll fully understand our company, product, and growth strategy and start to build up context for your product mindset.
- By day 90: You'll have shipped significant changes to our UIs that you had a hand in helping define the spec for. You'll also have learned where you feel you can contribute to outside of the engineering domain (growth, UX design, DevRel, etc.) and have contributed ideas around product and growth. We're all aligned and mutually excited about how we work together now and in the future!
