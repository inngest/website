We're excited to share that we're teaming up with our friends at Xata, Clerk, and Prisma to celebrate summer with a two-week hackathon üéâ

Join in, build a fun project, and win cash and swag prizes! 

## üìù Hackathon details

Over the past year, we've noticed more and more users building with the PXCI stack, which includes:

- Prisma: Prisma ORM is an open source Node.js and TypeScript ORM with a readable data model, automated migrations, type-safety, and auto-completion.
- Xata: Xata is a serverless data platform, built on PostgreSQL which provides a full-text and vector search engine, record-level file attachments, table-level aggregations and an optional ask endpoint to engage with with OpenAI's ChatGPT API.
- Clerk: Clerk is a User Management Platform, offering a complete suite of embeddable UIs, flexible APIs, and admin dashboards to authenticate and manage your users.
- and (yours truly) Inngest.

We decided to team up and host a hackathon for our joint community. Here are the details:

- **Teams:** solo or in a team of two.
- **Duration:** July 5 - July 17, 2024.
- **Format:** Individual or 2-person teams.
- **Requirements:** Use the free tier of the full stack (Xata, Clerk, Inngest, Prisma) to create an app.
- **Submission requirements:** Your code must be public and can't be a recycled project.
- **Submission deadline:** July 17, 2024 (midnight local time).

‚û°Ô∏è We have prepared a [PCXI starter project](https://github.com/inngest/next-pxci-starter) for you so you can start building right away!

## üí° What to build

This hackathon is an opportunity to explore and innovate with the PCXI stack. The submitted apps are judged based on the usage of the stack and their UX. Extra points are awarded for:
- Integrating AI into your project.
- Creating engaging content such as videos, blog posts, or social media updates to showcase your app.
