## üìù Hackathon details

Over the past year, we've noticed more and more users building with the PXCI stack. This stack enables you to quickly build reliable serverless applications that scale combining best tools for the job:
- [Xata](https://xata.io/), a database with with their managed PostgreSQL,
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) with their battle-tested ORM and database management tooling,
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/), which is already a standard and trusted tool for identity and authentication,
- and (yours truly) Inngest.

We are all teaming up now to host a hackathon for our joint community. Here are the details:

- **Teams:** solo or in a team of two.
- **Duration:** July 5 - July 17, 2024.
- **Format:** Individual or 2-person teams.
- **Requirements:** Use the free tier of the full stack (Xata, Clerk, Inngest, Prisma) to create an app.
- **Submission requirements:** Your code must be public and can't be a recycled project.
- **Submission deadline:** July 17, 2024 (midnight local time).
