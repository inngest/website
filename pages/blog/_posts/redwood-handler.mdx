The Inngest SDK has added official support for another framework - [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com/)!

Redwood is an opinionated, full-stack, JavaScript/TypeScript web application framework. It's built on top of React, GraphQL, and Prisma and is designed to make it easy to start a new project and scale to a large team.

Part of Redwood's roster is its [Serverless Functions](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/serverless-functions), which are a great way to add server-side logic to your application. Inngest's RedwoodJS handler allows you to deploy your functions to Inngest and use Inngest's event-driven infrastructure to trigger them.

<aside>To get started right away, check out our <a href="/docs/frameworks/redwoodjs?ref=blog-redwood-handler">RedwoodJS Framework Guide</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/inngest/sdk-example-redwoodjs-vercel">inngest/sdk-example-redwoodjs-vercel</a> repo.</aside>

Like [all of our other handlers](https://www.inngest.com/docs/functions?ref=blog-redwood-handler#serving), the Redwood handler is simple to use.

```ts
import { serve } from 'inngest/redwood'
import fns from 'src/inngest'

export const handler = serve('My RedwoodJS App', fns)
```

We can then use Inngest's existing deployment guides for popular Redwood targets like [Vercel](/docs/deploy/vercel) and [Netlify](/docs/deploy/netlify) to deploy our functions to Inngest.

## Why Redwood?

At Inngest, we want to support frameworks that already provide an incredible developer experience and enhance them by allowing developers to leverage event-driven architecture with a tiny amount of code.

Redwood is a fantastic framework for building serverless applications, but utilising background jobs usually requires running a stateful, always-on service - a significant extra burden to create and maintain, especially if you're just getting started.

By pairing Redwood with Inngest, you can deploy your serverless functions as usual and use Inngest's event-driven infrastructure to trigger them; use Redwood's serverless functions to handle your background jobs without worrying about running and maintaining a separate service.

## Getting started

Check out the [RedwoodJS Framework Guide](/docs/frameworks/redwoodjs) or the [inngest/sdk-example-redwoodjs-vercel](https://github.com/inngest/sdk-example-redwoodjs-vercel) repository to start your journey, or jump into our [Writing functions](/docs/functions) documentation to see what's possible with Inngest!
