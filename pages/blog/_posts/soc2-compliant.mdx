Inngest is proud to announce that we have achieved SOC 2 Type II compliance. This certification is a testament to our commitment to security and privacy, and our dedication to protecting our customers' data.

SOC 2 is a widely recognized security standard that ensures services securely manage data to protect the privacy of customers and the integrity of the organization itself. To achieve SOC 2 compliance, Inngest underwent a rigorous audit of our security practices, policies, and procedures. This audit was conducted by an independent independent auditor, [AssuranceLab](https://www.assurancelab.cpa/) who verified that our company and our platform meet the requirements of the SOC 2 standard.

The audit covered a wide range of areas, including data security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. By achieving SOC 2 compliance, Inngest has demonstrated that we have the necessary controls in place to protect our customers' data and ensure the security and privacy of their information.

## Security assessment

As part of the process, Inngest underwent a comprehensive independent platform security assessment by [Atredis Partners](https://www.atredis.com/). This assessment went beyond the standard penetration testing to cover our APIs and developer SDKs ensuring that not only is out platform secure, but the tools and libraries we provide to our customers are secure as well.

## New security documentation

In addition to the audit, we've documented additional details about how the Inngest platform securely communicates with your application. You can read this page which will continue to be updated in our [documentation](/docs/learn/security?ref=blog-soc2).

## End to end encryption middleware

Outside of the scope of the SOC 2 audit, Inngest provides an [end-to-end encryption middleware](/docs/learn/security?ref=blog-soc2#end-to-end-encryption) that allows you to encrypt your data before it is sent to our platform. In addition to the encryption at rest and in transit that we provide, this middleware allows you to encrypt your data before it leaves your application giving you full control over your data.

This encryption middleware is available for our [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-js/tree/main/packages/middleware-encryption) and is coming soon for [our Python SDK](/docs/reference/python/middleware/overview).

Our encryption middleware has already been in use in production by many customers. All middleware is open source and easy to modify to fit your specific needs.

## Future

Inngest is committed to maintaining our SOC 2 compliance and will undergo annual audits and reports to ensure that we continue to meet the requirements of the standard. We are also exploring additional certifications, such as ISO 27001, to further demonstrate our commitment to security and privacy.
